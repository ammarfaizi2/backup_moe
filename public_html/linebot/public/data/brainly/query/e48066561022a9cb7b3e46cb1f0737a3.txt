We started to learn language when we were born. However, people are used to speaking their native language, so immigrants are having many problems between the first generation and the second generation because they don't have the same native language. Also, the second generation is losing their identity. Especially in America, there are many immigrants that came from different countries to succeed in the States. Because they suffer in lots of areas such as getting a job and trying to speak English, they want their children to speak English, not only at school, but also at home in order to be more successful. Because of this situation, their children are losing their ethnic identity and, even more, they are ignoring their parents whose English is not very good.<br \/><br \/>\nFor example, my aunt, who has been living in Chicago for fifteen years, has three children and they were all born in the States. The eighteen year old daughter speaks English as a native language and she speaks Korean very well too. She has no problems talking with her parents, but she still doesn't understand Korean jokes, and there are sometimes misunderstandings. The second daughter is fourteen years old, and she doesn't want to speak Korean. My aunt often gets upset with her because she is very Americanized and they cannot understand each other. Even when my aunt punishes her, this daughter does not understand what my aunt is talking about. I felt sympathy for my aunt whenever my fourteen year old cousin said, \"Mom, what is your problem?\" The third child is a twelve year old son. He speaks English to his parents and my aunt speaks Korean to him as she does to the second daughter. He also has a problem communicating with his parents. My aunt is trying to teach him to speak both languages very well, but it is very hard for him because he speaks English all day and does not understand why he should learn to speak Korean.<br \/><br \/>\nI think most immigrants are trying to preserve their native language in their new country, but this doesn't help very much in getting a good job. My aunt didn't teach Korean to her children in order to help them succeed in the U.S.; she did so, hopefully, to help them establish a Korean identity. Though the second generation is born in the new country, they often get confused about their identity because they look different from others, and also, if they visit their parent's country, they will probably feel different from other people there too. My cousins told me that when they visited Korea a few years ago, they felt different from other Koreans. They could even feel it just strolling around the street because they wore different clothes and walked differently.<br \/><br \/>\nWe must realize that language is important and valuable for many reasons. Immigrants should make an effort not to be ignored by their children and to make their children understand their heritage by teaching them the parents' language. This is very important, not only for the harmony of the family, but also in helping the second generation establish their identity.<br \/>\n________________________________________<br \/>\n1\tLook at the title and scan the article quickly.

Sepertinya saat menulis surat ini, saya ingin pulang dan langsung memeluk kalian semua.<br \/><br \/>Ibu, bagaimana dengan ayah? Apakah dia baik-baik saja Beritahu ayah untuk tidak terlalu lelah saat bekerja. Hal itu bisa menurunkan daya tahannya. Oiya, ibu, beritahu Fiki untuk belajar keras, katakan padanya karena tidak malas lagi.<br \/><br \/>Ibu, maafkan aku, sepertinya tahun ini aku tidak bisa pulang. Saya baru saja dipromosikan sebagai manajer pemasaran di perusahaan tempat saya bekerja. Itu berarti ada lebih banyak pekerjaan yang harus saya lakukan. Juga, saat liburan datang, saya masih harus pergi ke kantor untuk menyelesaikan pekerjaan yang belum selesai. Tapi jangan khawatir, jika saya melakukan yang terbaik, maka saya akan dipromosikan di manajer cabang di kota kita, jadi saya tidak perlu tinggal jauh dari Anda.<br \/><br \/>Jadi, saya harus memberikan semua yang terbaik untuk perusahaan ini, Ibu. Yang saya lakukan adalah untuk performa yang lebih baik, sehingga, tahun depan saya bisa tinggal di rumah bersama dengan Anda, dengan ayah, dan Fiki.<br \/><br \/>Ketika saya kembali ke kota dan bekerja di sana, saya akan pulang setiap hari, dan Anda tahu, ibu, saya punya satu permintaan. Saya berharap Anda membuat makanan favorit saya setiap hari. Saya ingin makan sup ayam Anda, saya ingin makan sup kambing Anda sendiri, dan saya ingin mencicipi nasi goreng pedas yang Anda buat hampir setiap pagi saat berada di sekolah. Jangan lupakan ibu.",

A deer is sure to fall into it, and then we\u2019ll slaughter it together.\u201d<br \/><br \/>\u201cNo,\u201d replied Kabayan\u2019s father-in-law. \u201cYou dig the ditch, Kabayan. I\u2019d rather snare a bird.\u201d<br \/><br \/>\u201cGood,\u201d said Kabayan. \u201d But when I catch my deer, I won\u2019t give you any part of it.\u201d<br \/><br \/>\u201cNever mind,\u201d replied the father-in-law. \u201cWhen I snare my bird, you get no part of it either.\u201d<br \/><br \/>The next very morning, very, very early. Kabayan\u2019s father-in-law went outside to have a look at the trap he had set up. It was just as he had left it the night before. He walked over to Kabayan\u2019s trap and there he saw a fine, large deer. He looked about him stealthily and seeing no one, he tied a rope around the deer\u2019s neck, which he then fastened to his own trap. He quickly returned to the house and called his son-in-law.<br \/><br \/>\u201cKabayan, Kabayan, wake up!\u201d he shouted. \u201cLet\u2019s go out and see whether there\u2019s anything in our traps.\u201d.<br \/><br \/>Kabayan yawned and streched and joinde his father-in-law.<br \/><br \/>\u201cAlhamdullillah !

Kabayan did not appear. Kabayan\u2019s wife was worried. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d she asked her father. They waited , but he did not come.

It is not wrong at all, but in my opinion, the times in college are more fascinating. Moreover, I was in class D of IE, where I met the people I did not know at all at the first time but then became a new family for me, and from having no friends until finding bestfriends. at the first day we entered the classroom, we met a beautiful and kind woman, named miss Wiwit. We were told to stand in front of the class one by one to introduce ourselves. I was very nervous and scared, because that was the first time I introduced myself using English, in front of people who did not know me. At first I was scared and jealous with my friends who were quite fluent in English. Maybe it was because I used to hate learning English, and at college I was forced by my parents to major in English.<br \/>\nBut I didn\u2019t  regret the choice my parents made for me , and I would love it. I am now not afraid and jealous of my friends anymore, because mrs. wiwit said that in IE class we learn together . At that time, we were also asked by pack Chakim to write about our daily activities . It was the first time I wrote a story in English . I was confused how to begin , because I never liked to write . Moreover, the story should be written in English , at the time I wrote just a few , while my friends wrote very long . I do not want to lose my friends who fluently speak English and very well in writing stories in English .<br \/>\nEven though I could not speak English . But I tried not to be inferior , although sometimes I pronounced words in wrong ways . I once thought the lecturers of class D of IE were very fierce or evil . but actually, mr. Chakim and mrs. Wiwit  are very good and patient to teach us . class D of IE is very convenient because the class facilities are complete enough . I feel happy to be in class D because I have a lot of cool , funny , and silly friends . There was even silent friends , they are Mey and Dannys .the most ridiculous ones were  Aldi and Fendra . They both always made the atmosphere of the class became crowded , with their behavior . In class D I found a new friend named Hermin , Hermin was funny and beautiful  , we were always sat together .<br \/>\nTo the cafeteria or even to the toilet we were always together . the Activities in the classroom were very exciting because the students in our class are all active and the lecturers also good . I thought the hardest lesson is writing because writing is very difficult than speaking . Until now my skill in writing is still bad because I always use grammar in a wrong way. But my writing is now better than my writing at the first time I went to college . It is very difficult for me to use correct grammar in writing. Whenever I write stories , there are many wrong grammar. But my vocabularies already began to grow , and I'm now starting to enjoy learning English. Although it is pretty difficult , I will still continue to learn , so I could be like the others . there are Many things that I got from my experiences in the IE class D , from being afraid of speaking English to  be so dare to speak English. Class D is very compact in learning activities as well as the activities outside school hours .<br \/>\nI am very happy to have friends like all my classmates in class D of IE. They are always good and always share everything to each other . I hope someday when we are not classmates anymore , we can still stay in touch and not forgetting each other .<br \/>",

Ia adalah seekor Iguana hijau, tetapi namanya tidak me-representasikan warnanya; warnanya coklat dengan warna hitam pudar yang mengitari ekornya. Hero berukuran 40 cm dan berbobot sekitar 2.5 kg. Ia sangat menyukai sayur-sayuran. Hero memakan selada, wortek, timun, dan sayur-sayuran lain. Biasanya, aku memberikan Hero serangga kecil, yang bagus untuk tulang Hero agar Ia tidak terkena osteoporosis. Hero terlihat seperti naga kecil; Ia memiliki kaki yang kuat, kakinya berguna untuk berenang dan memanjat pohon<br \/><br \/>((Kurang lebih, translasinya seperti itu.

Dalam beberapa menit, aku mengubah Tina menjadi versi kecil diriku. Aku berdiri untuk memuji hasil pekerjaanku dan kemudian membandingkannya dengan yang lain dengan bangga.\u00a0<br \/><br \/>Kemudian anak-anak berbaris dan diwisuda. Acara itu benar-benar sempurna. Aku tidak tahan untuk tidak memperhatikan bahwa semua anak perempuan terlihat seperti hasil salinan yang ukurannya lebih kecil yang penuh warna\u00a0dari penata rias mereka alias ibu mereka. Acara setelah wisuda adalah pesta. Ibu-ibu dan para guru berteriak, dan semuanya dilakukan untuk membuat pesta tersebut serapi dan sebaik\u00a0mungkin. Anak-anak melakukan sesuai yang disuruh, kemudian beberapa dari mereka--kebanyakan anak laki-laki--memutuskan untuk memeriahkan suasana. Dalam beberapa menit mereka mengambil alih dan menjadi anak-anak. Balon-balon meletus, peluit-peluit ditiup, air disemporkan dan banyak lagi aktivitas yang sebenarnya dilarang tetapi tetap dinikmati. Para guru dan para ibu tetap berteriak tapi tidak satupun anak yang mendengarkan mereka. Keributan itu benar-benar parah. Aku setuju.\u00a0",

It usually flies slowly back and forth, about three meters above the ground, using its large eyes and sensitive hearing to spot likely prey. If suitable perches, such as fence posts, are available, the bird may save energy by hunting from these. Once it has swooped silently down, a hooked beak tears into the victim. Food is often swallowed whole and the indigestible parts, such as the bones and fur, are regurgitated in the form of pellets. <br \/>When seen in flight, the general impression is of a large white bird. However, the upper parts are a beautiful golden buff color, delicately marked in varying shades of buff and grey. It is only the face, breast, and undersides that are mostly white. <br \/>After choosing a suitable hole in a tree or a ledge in an old building, the female barn owl lays between four and seven eggs in April each year. The owlets are fully developed after ten weeks and leave the nest after about fourteen weeks, by which time they must be able to survive alone. As many as one in four young barn owls die within a year for a variety of reasons. <br \/>The number of barn owls in Britain is decreasing. There are now fewer habitats where they can find mice, moles, and other prey. In some areas, owls have been affected by chemicals and cannot lay proper eggs. This means that they cannot breed and increase their numbers. In addition, many birds have been killed accidentally as they fly across major roads and motorways. <br \/>The barn Owl is one of nature's most graceful hunters.

Brown kangaroos are the largest. They live in hot, dry regions that are a lot like deserts. When a baby kangaroo is born, it is no bigger than a cube of sugar. It grows inside the pouch on its mother\u2019s belly. After about five months, the baby called a joey starts to poke out its head. The joey  is  very  shy.  At  7  months,  it  will  occasionally  leave  the  pouch,  but  jump  backs in  at  the slightest danger. At the 8 months, the joey is too big to stay in its pouch. Sometimes it rubs its nose against it mother\u2019s as if they were giving each other a kiss. Like you, kangaroos have five fingers on each hand to put  leaves  in  their  mouths.They  also  like  to  graze  while  supporting  themselves  on their  front  paws. Kangaroos are very clean animals. After they have eaten, they clean their teeth by rubbing them with their paws. When it gets too hot, a kangaroo will lick its arms to refresh itself. The  father  kangaroo  is  about  two  times  as  heavy  as  the  mother.  Kangaroos  have  ears  as  large  as your mother\u2019s hands. In order to hear better, they can twist them in every direction. They can bounce up 9 meters, the length of a lorry. Kangaroos entertain themselves by boxing. They hit each other with their fists like real boxers. Their tail is very muscular and serve as a third leg.
