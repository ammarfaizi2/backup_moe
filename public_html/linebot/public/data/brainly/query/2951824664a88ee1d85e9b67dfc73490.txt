All this time you\u2019ve been such a very good friend to me.\u201d<br \/>\n\u201cDit, a marriage proposal is totally different from a business one. Just because you\u2019re so nice, just because you\u2019ve been my boy friend for two or three years, just because you\u2019re qualified to be a good husband, that doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m going to marry you. Is that understood?\u201d<br \/>\n\u201cAre you saying that you\u2019re the type who likes rude and unpredictable men to hang out with? Oh, get real, Mer. This is a serious matter. Answer me, please.\u201d<br \/>\n\u201cForget it, Dit. Being married to a friend of mine has never crossed my mind.\u201d<br \/>\nDidit kept pressing ahead with his proposal.

You\u2019re worth sharing my life with. Believe me.\u201d<br \/>\n\u201cSo, I meet your qualifications. But, that\u2019s too bad.

Can you mention the name of a man who\u2019s better than me, in your opinion.<br \/>\n\u201cEnough, Dit. I can\u2019t stand it anymore. But let me tell you a story. I remember a girl, named Citra, the girl who called me one night in tears. Using their vulnerable long distance relations as an excuse, a man named Aditya Pramana had the heart to abandon her and abruptly cancel their wedding that had been planned for years. And it happened only a month before the wedding. And this Aditya Pramana certainly had no idea that Citra was my cousin. She was the reason for my refusal. Now, I\u2019ve told you my reason.

                        "content": "A tragic end to an education that had barely begun 13-year-old FARIDA stopped schooling because her classmates used to make fun of her relentlessly. They had accidentally discovered her humble background, her father being a street vendor. In another case, 15 year old SLAMET RISKA could not take it anymore. She became depressed, left school and stayed at home because she was constantly teased by her classmates for failing in junior high school.<br \/><br \/>\nAnd in yet another, more recent case, some senior students of a junior high school took seven junior students, and subjected them to violent beatings. Sherry, one of the junior students, was rushed to hospital with bruises on his abdomen. He is extremely scared to go to school. Julie, a 10 year old, fifth grade student, states that her first two years of elementary school were a traumatic experience. She sadly remembers being cruelly bullied by her male classmates because she was overweight. They used to call her Sumatran elephant, baboon, gentong and many other names.<br \/>\n            These are few cases out of hundreds of similar cases and the number is increasing over the time. In Indonesia bullying exists in every form, from teasing to extreme abuse. Even though incidents of bullying are common, unfortunately it is not seen as a major problem. A recent survey conducted by National Child Protection Commission has shown that more than half of bullying incidents go unreported due to the fact that it is considered normal in some parts of the society. Also the people who get bullied are either unwilling to report it because they feel it will \u201cmake a big deal\u201d. Or worse, they are so scared that they don't trust anyone and do not want to share their plight with anyone (http:\/\/www.asianewsnet.net\/news-34263.html). The issue of bullying has been a problem for years but recently it got limelight from news media when few cases were reported.<br \/><br \/>\nBullying affects the children both psychologically and physically. It is estimated that hundreds of children miss school every day due to the fear of being mistreated by other students and in some extreme cases they choose to home school, or in severe circumstances they stop studying altogether (http:\/\/www.bullyingstatistics.org\/content\/facts-on-bullying.html). Children should not be living in constant fear. They shouldn't be afraid. On the contrary, they should look forward to every day of school and enjoy school life. According to a research bullying has always existed in Indonesian society, but it has come to surface due to the recent proliferation of media technologies (Craig, 2009). Since bullying is prevalent in our society it is important that everyone should be made aware of this social evil. There should be campaigns to increase awareness. Everyone should be working together, against it, to stop it. It is distressing to see our children being isolated from society because they are treated badly. I am of opinion that no one has any right to harass or make people feel inferior. No one should have that kind of power. These children are our future and we should make every possible effort to stop bullying.<br \/><br \/>\nI would like to point out that bullying is everyone's problem and responsibility. If you condone bullying in any way, shape or form it means you are taking part in it whether it is directly or indirectly by being silent. Majority of people agree that we have to work together towards eliminating this problem. Some people may consider taunting someone as funny, even though it is anything but funny to the person who is at the receiving end. Minor taunts can create a lot of pain and suffering. While it may seem innocent but the cumulative effect could be highly damaging. In addition to that, as the pain increases, each instance cuts a little deeper which eventually becomes a sore.<br \/><br \/>\n            It is highly possible that bullying might happen in your school so it is the liability of every student to protect their classmates and try to stop bullying. If it doesn't work then you should inform your teachers or parents. Not many of us think of stopping it. As long as it doesn't happen to us why should we get involved, why should we bother? But the time has come for us to be actively involved in eradicating bullying (Farrington, 1993). So next time if you see someone getting bullied, would you try to stop it or let it happen? Remember, bullying is everyone's problem.<br \/><br \/>\nCari kalimat opini dari cerita diatas?",

                        "highlighted_content": "A tragic end to an education that had barely begun 13-year-old FARIDA stopped schooling because her classmates used to make fun of her relentlessly. They had accidentally discovered her humble background, her father being a street vendor. In another case, 15 year old <em>SLAM<\/em>ET RISKA could not take it anymore. She became depressed, left school and stayed at home because she was constantly teased by her classmates for failing in junior high school.\nAnd in yet another, more recent case, some senior students of a junior high school took seven junior students, and subjected them to violent beatings. Sherry, one of the junior students, was rushed to hospital with bruises on his abdomen. He is extremely scared to go to school. Julie, a 10 year old, fifth grade student, states that her first two years of elementary school were a traumatic experience. She sadly remembers being cruelly bullied by her male classmates because she was overweight. They used to call her Sumatran elephant, baboon, gentong and many other names.\n            These are few cases out of hundreds of similar cases and the number is increasing over the time. In Indonesia bullying exists in every form, from teasing to extreme abuse. Even though incidents of bullying are common, unfortunately it is not seen as a major problem. A recent survey conducted by National Child Protection Commission has shown that more than half of bullying incidents go unreported due to the fact that it is considered normal in some parts of the society. Also the people who get bullied are either unwilling to report it because they feel it will \u201cmake a big deal\u201d. Or worse, they are so scared that they don't trust anyone and do not want to share their plight with anyone (http:\/\/www.asianewsnet.net\/news-34263.html). The issue of bullying has been a problem for years but recently it got limelight from news media when few cases were reported.\nBullying affects the children both psychologically and physically. It is estimated that hundreds of children miss school every day due to the fear of being mistreated by other students and in some extreme cases they choose to home school, or in severe circumstances they <em>stop<\/em> studying altogether (http:\/\/www.bullyingstatistics.org\/content\/facts-on-bullying.html). Children should not be living in constant fear. They shouldn't be afraid. On the contrary, they should look forward to every day of school and enjoy school life. According to a research bullying has always existed in Indonesian society, but it has come to surface due to the recent proliferation of media technologies (Craig, 2009). Since bullying is prevalent in our society it is important that everyone should be made aware of this social evil. There should be campaigns to increase awareness. Everyone should be working together, against it, to <em>stop<\/em> it. It is distressing to see our children being isolated from society because they are treated badly. I am of opinion that no one has any right to harass or make people feel inferior. No one should have that kind of power. These children are our future and we should make every possible effort to <em>stop<\/em> bullying.\nI would like to point out that bullying is everyone's problem and responsibility. If you condone bullying in any way, shape or form it means you are taking part in it whether it is directly or indirectly by being silent. Majority of people agree that we have to work together towards eliminating this problem. Some people may consider taunting someone as funny, even though it is anything but funny to the person who is at the receiving end. Minor taunts can create a lot of pain and suffering. While it may seem innocent but the cumulative effect could be highly damaging. In addition to that, as the pain increases, each instance cuts a little deeper which eventually becomes a sore.\n            It is highly possible that bullying might happen in your school so it is the liability of every student to protect their classmates and try to <em>stop<\/em> bullying. If it doesn't work then you should inform your teachers or parents. Not many of us think of stopping it. As long as it doesn't happen to us why should we get involved, why should we bother? But the time has come for us to be actively involved in eradicating bullying (Farrington, 1993). So next time if you see someone getting bullied, would you try to <em>stop<\/em> it or let it happen? Remember, bullying is everyone's problem.\nCari kalimat opini dari cerita diatas?",

A recent survey conducted by National Child Protection Commission has shown that more than half of bullying incidents go unreported due to the fact that it is considered normal in some parts of the society. Also the people who get bullied are either unwilling to report it because they feel it will \u201cmake a big deal\u201d.

Children should not be living in constant fear. They shouldn't be afraid. On the contrary, they should look forward to every day of school and enjoy school life. According to a research bullying has always existed in Indonesian society, but it has come to surface due to the recent proliferation of media technologies (Craig, 2009). Since bullying is prevalent in our society it is important that everyone should be made aware of this social evil. There should be campaigns to increase awareness.

If you condone bullying in any way, shape or form it means you are taking part in it whether it is directly or indirectly by being silent.

He did not know where they had flown. He searched for the net but could not find it.<br \/>\nBhim then bought a new net. Again the same thing happened.

There our friends will set you free.\u201d<br \/>\n\u201cWhat a good idea!\u201d said the quails.<br \/>\nThe next day, Bhim cast his net over some quails. At once they flew away with the net. He did not know where they had flown. He searched for the net but could not find it.<br \/>\nBhim then bought a new net. Again the same thing happened. The birds flew away with the net.<br \/>\nBhim and his wife were unhappy. \u201cHow can we make our living now?\u201d said the wife.<br \/>\n\u201cDon\u2019t you worry,\u201d said Bhim. \u201cThe birds have learned to work together.

One of them said, \u201cWe are able to escape because I am strong enough to lift the net.\u201d Another bird said, \u201cI am the strongest.

Soon Bhim drew in his net and took the birds home.<br \/>\n\u201cLook!\u201d he said, showing the quails to his wife. \u201cDidn\u2019t  I tell you that they wouldn\u2019t stand together much longer?

He was very disturbed and unhappy, he said.<br \/>\n To the rest of God\u2019s creatures, it might have seemed that Gecko ought to have no reason at <br \/>\nall to complain. He could do so many things that other creatures could not, such as walk on the <br \/>\nwall, or upside down on the ceiling. He could do this because he had little pads on the tip of each <br \/>\nof his toes. Not only that, if his tail should be lost in a battle with another lizard, he would be able <br \/>\nto grow another one, just as good as, if not better than, the old one. His smaller cousin, Cicak, <br \/>\nwas much more active and mobile, darting across the wall as he chased his mate, sometimes <br \/>\nstopping for a short climb up a sideboard to sample some sweet or other, while Gecko expended <br \/>\na minimum of energy, sitting lazily up in the rafters, going out at night in search of mosquitoes, <br \/>\nfi lling the night with his raucous calls. What would Gecko ever have to complain about?<br \/>\nBut now Gecko was upset. For several weeks he had not been able to sleep because of Firefl y. <br \/>\nNight after night the black lightning beetle with red and yellow spots fl ew around and about him, <br \/>\nglowing like sparks of fi re, fl ashing his light into Gecko\u2019s eyes.<br \/>\nThe Chief, who really did not like his sleep to be disturbed either, was sympathetic, and <br \/>\npromised to make an investigation. He asked Gecko to come back to see him in a week or so.<br \/>\nThe next day the Chief called Firefl y and told him about Gecko\u2019 complaint. \u201cIs it only Gecko <br \/>\nyou are disturbing?\u201d he asked, \u201cor is it possible that others are also bothered by your light fl ash-<br \/>\ning into their eyes?\u201dFirefl y\u2019 light was out now, as he spoke very humbly to the Chief. \u201cI meant no harm, sir. In <br \/>\nfact, I thought I was doing something good. I heard the drumming of Woodpecker as he struck <br \/>\nhis bill on the tree trunk, and I thought it was a kulkul calling villagers to get up and gather. I was <br \/>\nonly fl ashing my light to pass on the message.\u201d<br \/>\n The Chief then decided to ask Woodpecker about this. He found him and told him what <br \/>\nFirefl y had said.<br \/>\n \u201cI too was only passing on a warning, sir,\u201d said Woodpecker. \u201cI heard the kwak-kwak-kwak <br \/>\nof Frog in the rice paddies, and I thought it was a warning that an earthquake was coming. So I <br \/>\njust passed on the message.\u201d<br \/>\n Now the chief went in search of Frog, who meanwhile had heard that he would be inter-<br \/>\nrogated. \u201cThe reason I was kwak-kwak-kwaking more and louder than usual,\u201d he explained, \u201cis <br \/>\nthat I saw Black Beetle walking down the road carrying fi lth, which I thought was so dirty and so <br \/>\nunhygienic that I had to stop him.\u201d<br \/>\n \u201cThat is indeed bad,\u201d thought the Chief. \u201cI must speak to Beetle at once.\u201d<br \/>\n Black Beetle, plump and gleaming like polished copper, was also very humble and respect-<br \/>\nful, as he explained the situation.<br \/>\n \u201cYou see, sir, Water Buffalo comes by dropping his pat in the middle of the road, and I just <br \/>\nthought it was my duty to clean it up.\u201d<br \/>\n The Chief was now beginning to lose patience. \u201cTell Water Buffalo I wish to see him!\u201d he <br \/>\nordered.<br \/>\n When Water Buffalo appeared, he was polite, but he expressed his displeasure with Beetle\u2019s <br \/>\nreport.<br \/>\n \u201cIt is clear,\u201d he said, \u201cthat I am not appreciated. Rain washes away all the stones in the road, <br \/>\nand I fi ll up the holes. Who else does that, I ask you?\u201d<br \/>\n By this time the Village Chief was tired, but he had to hear Rain\u2019s story. And Rain was angry.<br \/>\n\u201cComplaining about ME?\u201d he asked. \u201cWho asks the gods for Rain, even makes offerings to them <br \/>\nso they will send Rain? Without ME there are no mosquitoes, and if there are no mosquitoes, Gecko <br \/>\nis hungry and unhappy. Don\u2019t speak to me. Speak to Gecko!\u201d<br \/>\nWhen Gecko returned to the home of the Chief as he had been requested to do, the Chief spoke <br \/>\nto him very sternly indeed.<br \/>\n\u201cGecko, say no more. We all have our problems. Go home, and live at peace with all your neigh-<br \/>\nbours!\u201d<br \/>\nAdapted from Alibasah, 1999.<br \/>\nQuestions <br \/>\n1.

After Gecko lodged the complaint, who was the fi rst to investigate?<br \/>\n5. What was the Firefl y\u2019s reason of fl ashing the lights?<br \/>\n6.
