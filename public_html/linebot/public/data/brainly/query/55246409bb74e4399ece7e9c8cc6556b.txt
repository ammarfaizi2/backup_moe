Brown kangaroos are the largest. They live in hot, dry regions that are a lot like deserts. When a baby kangaroo is born, it is no bigger than a cube of sugar. It grows inside the pouch on its mother\u2019s belly. After about five months, the baby called a joey starts to poke out its head. The joey  is  very  shy.  At  7  months,  it  will  occasionally  leave  the  pouch,  but  jump  backs in  at  the slightest danger. At the 8 months, the joey is too big to stay in its pouch. Sometimes it rubs its nose against it mother\u2019s as if they were giving each other a kiss. Like you, kangaroos have five fingers on each hand to put  leaves  in  their  mouths.They  also  like  to  graze  while  supporting  themselves  on their  front  paws. Kangaroos are very clean animals. After they have eaten, they clean their teeth by rubbing them with their paws. When it gets too hot, a kangaroo will lick its arms to refresh itself. The  father  kangaroo  is  about  two  times  as  heavy  as  the  mother.  Kangaroos  have  ears  as  large  as your mother\u2019s hands. In order to hear better, they can twist them in every direction. They can bounce up 9 meters, the length of a lorry. Kangaroos entertain themselves by boxing. They hit each other with their fists like real boxers. Their tail is very muscular and serve as a third leg.

Many people call platypus duckbill because this animal has a bill like duckbill. Platypus can also called as watermole or duckmole.<br \/>\nThe name \"platypus\" is often prefixed with the adjective \"duck-billed\" to form duck-billed platypus, despite there being only one species of platypus. <br \/><br \/>\nPlatypus is a mammal, although it has some different characteristic with other mammal. It gives births with laying her eggs, but it still has a pair of milk gland. Although possessing mammary glands, the platypus lacks teats. Instead, milk is released through pores in the skin. The platypus is carnivorous mammal and eats like a small fish, frog, and fish egg.<br \/><br \/>\nPlatypus has a flat tail and webbed feet. Its weight varies considerably from 0.7 to 2.4 kg, with males being larger than females. Males average 50 cm in total length, while females average 43 cm. Its body covered with a thick, and woolly layer of fur. The platypus has an average body temperature of about 32\u00b0C (90\u00b0F) rather than the 37\u00b0C (99\u00b0F).<br \/>\nIts bill is detecting prey and stirring up mud. Usually it ate crustaceans. A platypus has a eyes and head are small. Its eyes contains double cones, which most mammals do not have. It has no ears but has ability to sense sound and lights. Platypus lives in streams, rivers, and lakes.<br \/>\nFemale platypus usually dig burrows in the streams or river banks. The burrows are blocked with soil to protect it from intruders and flooding. In the other hand, male platypus does not need any burrow to stay.<br \/><br \/>\nTolong Carikan , Kalimat LINKING VERB,RELATING VERB&amp;BEHAVIORAL PLEASE:)",
