Lebih lagi, kami mendapatkan liburan yang cukup panjang\/lama, sehingga kami dapat menikmati \"hadiah\" tersebut dengan senang hati.

This art \ngave Johnsy the power to sustain her 'hope' to live and indeed, until \nhope persists,\u00a0\"it is a sin to want to die\".<br \/>2.\u00a0\u00a0I \nrather think that she said so because that painting returned her friend \nthe desire for living, Johnsy was depressed, and she was just waiting to\n die when the last leaf fell down, but that image helped her going on.<br \/>3.\n yes, i were suprised with the ending story.\u00a0So the surprise ending was \nthe final realization that the last leaf was not real but a painting \nseemed to have a magical healing power to renewed Joans will to love and\n to defeat her pneumonia.<br \/>4. i think he had known<span>\u00a0it would result in his death. he said, \" \nsome day i shall paint my masterpiece, and we shall all go away from \nhere.\" he believed that the painting would help Sue and Johnsy.<br \/><\/span>5. i will stay with my friend. we don't know when we will be sick and die, when we will need someone to care about us.<br \/>6.\n because he believed that he was a special duty to do everything \npossible to help sue and johnsy, and he believed that his masterpiece \ncould help to make johnsy better from her condition.<br \/>7. if i were mr \nbehrman, i would have done like it. i am old woman and i don't have \nanything to make me usefulness for the others.<br \/>8. the greatest \nsacrifice i have ever made for my family is: make my parents proud. it's\n really very hard for me. when my friend asked me to play with them, i \nshould study hard at home. i use my spare time to do something useful, \nhelps my parents, my sisters and do what the best i do.<br \/>9.\u00a0<span>Behrman is a person who wants others to be happy. Although when\n for the first time sue told him about Jhonsy's fantasies about the leaf\n he reacted very badly but to give Jhonsy moral support which can be \nprovided to her by preventing the last leaf from falling he risked his \nlife and painted a picture of the last leaf on the opposite wall in the \nterrible cold weather. he is a down to earth person and a gem in \nmillions.<br \/><\/span>10. because Johnsy\u00a0compared her life with number of leaves.\u00a0when the number of leaves going to decrease the expectation of life also become decreased.\u00a0when she looked out side she found\u00a0that the leaf is there, she felt energetic towards life.\n\n    <br \/><br \/><br \/>",

Although when for the first \ntime sue told him about Jhonsy's fantasies about the leaf he reacted \nvery badly but to give Jhonsy moral support which can be provided to her\n by preventing the last leaf from falling he risked his life and painted\n a picture of the last leaf on the opposite wall in the terrible cold \nweather. he is a down to earth person and a gem in millions.<br \/><\/span>10. because Johnsy\u00a0compared her life with number of leaves.\u00a0when the number of leaves going to decrease the expectation of life also become decreased.\u00a0when she looked out side she found\u00a0that the leaf is there, she felt energetic towards life.\n\n    <br \/><br \/>",

They say London is really beautiful by night, and i'm really looking forward to seeing all those famous places. On the Friday we're going to the Tate Modern (the art gallery near the riverThames),  then to the Design Museum it's not far from our hotel,  so we're planning to walk there.

We're going to Portobello Road first. Then in afternoon,  we're visiting Harrods - the most famous shop in London! Dad's not very happy about it,  but I'm sure he'll enjoy it when we're there.

It was brightly coloured, with long, curly tassels and a long string.The Paper Kite was so high up, above all the trees and other kites, that it was giddy with excitement. Admiring itself, it said loudly, \u201cLook at me flying so gracefully! If I were free, I could go far away.\u201dThe Paper Kite tugged at its string, as it wanted to fly right through the clouds and above the eagles. However, the string was strong and held it tight.The Paper Kite impatiently tugged at its string again, and the string broke.The Paper Kite was full of joy.

Free of its string, the Paper Kite had become too heavy and could not control itself. It drifted towards the sea and was washed away in the tide.The Paper Kite cried, \u201cO poor me! I wanted to fly higher and higher. Look what I got for being so proud.\u201dquestion:1.)what is the first story mainly about?2.) what's the second story mainly about?",

But in order to die peacefully, I must tell my story.<br \/>\n My wife and I loved pets. One of my wife\u2019s favorite pets was Pluto, the cat. Pluto was a very clever black cat.<br \/>\n One day I came home very drunk. I was in a very bad temper. For some reasons, Pluto made me angry. In a rage I seized the cat, took a small knife out of my pocket and cut its throat and took one of its eyes out ! Then I hanged the poor creature until it was dead<br \/>\n The next morning, I wake up and remembered what I had done and I felt sorry very much. I buried my memory in the drink.<br \/>\n One night my house was burning. There was nothing left, but a strange thing happened. I found out in my bedroom wall the shape of a huge cat with one eye and a rope around its neck. I was terrified and could not forget such a horrible sight.<br \/>\n I regretted and felt sorry for Pluto so I bought another cat to take Pluto\u2019s place. This cat had a white patch on its chest.<br \/>\n I soon began to dislike the cat because it often stared at me with a strange and hatred look. It terrified me very much.<br \/>\n One day my wife and I went to the cellar. I was getting drunk at that time. The cat followed us. It got between my feet and nearly made me trip down the stairs. I was carrying an axe in my hand. I was so angry that I raised my axe wanting to kill the poor animal when my wife prevented me from doing so. My rage soon directed the axe at her. She fell dead at my feet.<br \/>\nThen I dug a grave to hide her body inside the cellar wall.

But in order to die peacefully, I must tell my story.\n My wife and I loved pets. One of my wife\u2019s favorite pets was Pluto, the cat. Pluto was a very clever black cat.\n One day I came <em>home<\/em> very drunk. I was in a very bad temper. For some reasons, Pluto made me angry. In a rage I seized the cat, took a small knife out of my pocket and cut its throat and took one of its eyes out ! Then I hanged the poor creature until it was dead\n The next morning, I wake up and remembered what I had done and I felt sorry very much. I buried my memory in the drink.\n One night my house was burning. There was nothing left, but a strange thing happened. I found out in my bedroom wall the shape of a huge cat with one eye and a rope around its neck. I was terrified and could not forget such a horrible sight.\n I regretted and felt sorry for Pluto so I bought another cat to take Pluto\u2019s place. This cat had a white patch on its chest.\n I soon began to dislike the cat because it often stared at me with a strange and hatred look. It terrified me very much.\n One day my wife and I went to the cellar. I was getting drunk at that time. The cat followed us. It got between my feet and nearly made me trip down the stairs. I was carrying an axe in my hand. I was so angry that I raised my axe wanting to kill the poor animal when my wife prevented me from doing so. My rage soon directed the axe at her. She fell dead at my feet.\nThen I dug a grave to hide her body inside the cellar wall. I looked for the cat because I decided to kill it too, but I couldn\u2019t find it anywhere.\nThe fourth day after the death of my wife, the police came to my house because of my neighbours\u2019 suspicion. The police searched the house and found nothing. I was so glad that I said, \u201c Gentlemen, this is a well-built house.

Tertarik dengan warnanya,saya mengambilnya,lalu fanny dan saya membacanya. Kami saya kaget,itu adalah kupon 4 malam tur ke lombok!! hari kadaluarsanya hari itu. mengejutkan kami,sama seperti fanny teman saya,dan itu juga berlaku untuk dua orang. Itu bagus!! Kami berfikir itu mungkin kupon jatuh dari langit dan untuk kami. <br \/>Kami buru-buru ke alamat tur agen itu mengecek kupon. Tur agen menyiapkan semuanya. Kita sampai di rumah dan masih tidak percaya itu. 2 hari kemudian kami berada di pantai senggigi,berbaring di bawah matahari yg panas. Selain itu,kita mempunyai liburan publik yang panjang,jadi kami bisa menikmati \"hadiah\" dengan senang. Kami juga membeli beberapa kado untuk keluarga dan teman kami. <br \/><br \/>(Ada bbrp teks yg typo d cerita d ats tp ak prbaiki dan mngrti. smoga membantu)",

Tapi bagi saya ritual khusus ini tidak pernah cukup tampaknya untuk lulus. <span>Dan ketika saudara saya - tiga tahun lebih muda dari saya - mulai naik\n dengan semua semangat dari Pee wee Herman-, saya menyadari ada masalah.<br \/><\/span>Insting pertama saya adalah untuk menyembunyikan kegagalan saya sehingga teman-teman saya tidak akan pernah tahu. Saya\n menjadi rollerblader sangat bagus dan saya punya satu set dipercaya \nalasan di tangan di acara saya pernah diminta untuk pergi bersepeda \ngunung.

SMA\n adalah semua tentang muncul terlambat, tampak bosan dan menyeret \nmelalui lorong-lorong dengan kecepatan menjengkelkan kasual. Itu, secara harfiah, masyarakat anti-sepeda. Saya bangga menjadi non-biker, menghindari ketepatan waktu, celana pendek dan kesehatan jantung yang datang dengan itu. Aku punya satu teman yang ingin menjadi kurir sepeda. <span>Ia sebagian besar dikucilkan.<br \/><\/span>Aku\n mencoba sekali lagi di kelas 10 setelah mengakui rahasiaku dengan \nseorang gadis dalam upaya terakhir untuk memulai seksual Tour de France.\n <span>Setelah satu jam betis-tergores ejekan dan perjalanan singkat ke base \nkedua, saya menarik diri dari balapan dan tidak pernah membuka mulut \nlagi.<br \/><\/span>Lance Armstrong Skandal diperkuat keengganan saya di masa dewasa: aku punya firasat buruk tentang dia dari awal. <span>Bahkan saya tidak mendorong pedal untuk 10 tahun ke depan.<br \/><\/span>Aku mungkin sudah lupa, tapi ibu saya tidak pernah melakukannya. Satu panas, tidak curiga sore Juli, dia tidak bisa tahan lagi. <span>Dia meraih saya, memberi saya sepedanya dan mengirim saya ke sekolah, mengatakan tidak pergi sampai aku pelajari.<br \/><\/span>Setelah\n sedikit pengawasan yang seksama untuk memastikan tidak ada seorang pun \nyang terlihat, saya naik kapal binatang - sepeda perempuan yang tiga \nukuran terlalu kecil. Aku diluncurkan ke perang strategis dengan masa kanak-kanak dan dekade-aktif saya keseimbangan. Haruskah saya mengayuh pertama?

Lima detik pada awalnya, maka saya panik dan terbalik, tapi aku berbalik dan mulai lagi. Sepuluh detik, 20 detik dan kemudian satu menit penuh tanpa mencium trotoar. Aku merasakan embusan udara baru yang segar di paru-paru saya, napas yang sedikit lebih lengkap. Saya yakin tangisan saya \"Hey! Hey! Lihat\n ini! \"Menarik lebih dari beberapa tetangga untuk jendela mereka untuk \nmelihat seorang pria ditumbuhi rendah-anggaran berlakunya kembali ET <span>Extra-Terrestrial.<br \/><\/span>Apakah keterampilan baru ditemukan ini memulai kebangkitan heran anak kecil dan menjadi?

Becak, roda pelatihan - tidak ada masalah. Tapi versi roda dua terbukti merepotkan. <span>Saya akan mulai bergerak dengan baik, tapi kemudian, dengan kelincahan\n seorang seniman trapeze mabuk, aku akan memiringkan, panik dan \nmeletakkan kaki saya turun sebagai pedal terus berputar dan menampar \nsaya di belakang kaki.<br \/><\/span>Itu bukan masalah besar pada awalnya. Semua teman-teman saya belajar juga. Ini adalah ritus perjalanan. Tapi bagi saya ritual khusus ini tidak pernah cukup tampaknya untuk lulus. <span>Dan ketika saudara saya - tiga tahun lebih muda dari saya - mulai naik\n dengan semua semangat dari Pee wee Herman-, saya menyadari ada masalah.<br \/><\/span>Insting pertama saya adalah untuk menyembunyikan kegagalan saya sehingga teman-teman saya tidak akan pernah tahu. Saya\n menjadi rollerblader sangat bagus dan saya punya satu set dipercaya \nalasan di tangan di acara saya pernah diminta untuk pergi bersepeda \ngunung. Aku bahkan dicuci otak sendiri menjadi percaya dalam kebajikan tidak naik sepeda. Memompa ban, mengoles rantai, menguncinya di mana-mana Anda pergi, semuanya tampak seperti kerumitan bagi saya. <span>Dan yang terlihat baik di helm?<br \/><\/span><span>Tapi akan ada satu Minggu tenang setiap musim panas ketika aku akan \nberjalan sepeda saya ke sekolah dalam kerahasiaan, naik, ujung atas dan \nhop off, saya tergores betis pencegah cukup kuat sampai tahun depan.<br \/><\/span>Orang tua saya membawa sulit. Apakah ada tanda lebih besar dari ayah yang gagal daripada anak yang tidak bisa naik sepeda? Setidaknya aku bisa melempar bisbol (mengerikan). Setelah\n bertahun-tahun berjalan bersama saya, memegang bagian belakang tempat \nduduk saya, mereka mengambil langkah-langkah drastis. Sementara\n kami sedang berlibur di Lake Placid, NY, mereka mencari jasa seorang \nbijak bersepeda yang tugasnya adalah untuk mengajarkan orang untuk naik \nsepeda. <span>Setelah tiga jam nyamuk-digigit di hutan, dia mulai mempertanyakan karirnya.<br \/><\/span>Setelah saya masuk SMA, kemampuan Schwinn-kurang saya dilupakan. SMA\n adalah semua tentang muncul terlambat, tampak bosan dan menyeret \nmelalui lorong-lorong dengan kecepatan menjengkelkan kasual. Itu, secara harfiah, masyarakat anti-sepeda. Saya bangga menjadi non-biker, menghindari ketepatan waktu, celana pendek dan kesehatan jantung yang datang dengan itu. Aku punya satu teman yang ingin menjadi kurir sepeda. <span>Ia sebagian besar dikucilkan.<br \/><\/span>Aku\n mencoba sekali lagi di kelas 10 setelah mengakui rahasiaku dengan \nseorang gadis dalam upaya terakhir untuk memulai seksual Tour de France.\n <span>Setelah satu jam betis-tergores ejekan dan perjalanan singkat ke base \nkedua, saya menarik diri dari balapan dan tidak pernah membuka mulut \nlagi.<br \/><\/span>Lance Armstrong Skandal diperkuat keengganan saya di masa dewasa: aku punya firasat buruk tentang dia dari awal. <span>Bahkan saya tidak mendorong pedal untuk 10 tahun ke depan.<br \/><\/span>Aku mungkin sudah lupa, tapi ibu saya tidak pernah melakukannya. Satu panas, tidak curiga sore Juli, dia tidak bisa tahan lagi. <span>Dia meraih saya, memberi saya sepedanya dan mengirim saya ke sekolah, mengatakan tidak pergi sampai aku pelajari.<br \/><\/span>Setelah\n sedikit pengawasan yang seksama untuk memastikan tidak ada seorang pun \nyang terlihat, saya naik kapal binatang - sepeda perempuan yang tiga \nukuran terlalu kecil. Aku diluncurkan ke perang strategis dengan masa kanak-kanak dan dekade-aktif saya keseimbangan. Haruskah saya mengayuh pertama? Mendorong dan kemudian pedal? <span>Apakah saya masih memiliki roda pelatihan di garasi?<br \/><\/span>Setelah\n satu jam setengah dari anak sapi tergores, amukan internal dan ancaman \natrofi testis dari mistar gawang perempuan, akhirnya saya mulai pergi. Lima detik pada awalnya, maka saya panik dan terbalik, tapi aku berbalik dan mulai lagi. Sepuluh detik, 20 detik dan kemudian satu menit penuh tanpa mencium trotoar. Aku merasakan embusan udara baru yang segar di paru-paru saya, napas yang sedikit lebih lengkap. Saya yakin tangisan saya \"Hey! Hey! Lihat\n ini! \"Menarik lebih dari beberapa tetangga untuk jendela mereka untuk \nmelihat seorang pria ditumbuhi rendah-anggaran berlakunya kembali ET <span>Extra-Terrestrial.<br \/><\/span>Apakah keterampilan baru ditemukan ini memulai kebangkitan heran anak kecil dan menjadi? Sama sekali tidak. Bahkan, saya masih benar-benar payah. <span>Saya mengalami kesulitan kemudi, dan menguasai rem mungkin membawa saya lagi 25 tahun.<br \/><\/span>Tapi aku belajar satu hal: keberhasilan Anda tidak mendefinisikan Anda, kegagalan Anda lakukan. Merangkul kegagalan Anda - mereka membuat Anda pergi. Jika kita hanya memiliki keberhasilan kita akan memiliki apa-apa untuk hidup. Dan\n jika Anda tidak dapat cukup memecahkan kode, meletakkannya, tetapi \ntidak pernah pergi, bahkan jika itu membawa Anda 10 tahun. <span>Ini seperti naik sepeda.<\/span><\/span><br \/>",
