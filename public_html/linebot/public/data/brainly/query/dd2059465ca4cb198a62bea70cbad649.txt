The video will be \nin Turkish of course! But first, I thought I\u2019d share my summary points \nof the Turkish language with you!\n<span>It won\u2019t be as detailed as my usual language summaries, since I ran into a few (non linguistic) problems this summer, but I learned enough to definitely get by in Turkish and have a great understanding of sentence structure and how the language works from my part-time studies.<\/span>\nTurkish in a nutshell\n<span>As always, my stance is to stand by the certainty that there is no such thing as a hard language, once you have the right learning approach and attitude.<\/span>\n<span>And along the same lines as other language summaries, I\u2019m titling this as \u201cWhy X is easy \/ not hard\u201d (as I did in Hungarian, German and Czech).\n Most of the time I have to do this when natives or learners are so \nreligiously devoted to deluding themselves that it\u2019s the \u201chardest \nlanguage in the world\u201d. After hearing that for over a dozen languages, \nit starts to get quite tedious, as well as dreadfully illogical.<\/span>\n<span>Luckily that\u2019s not so necessary with Turkish because <strong>locals are extremely encouraging <\/strong>when\n you try to speak some Turkish. They are a proud people, and usually \nonly refer to the \u201cgossip\u201d case to prove that the language is hard (but \nit\u2019s as hard\/easy as the subjunctive mood in Spanish for example), and \nwill be thrilled to see you trying to speak it.<\/span>\nAs well as this, many features of the language are <em>very<\/em> logical and consistent, even if they are <em>of course<\/em> different enough to make you feel the language is weird at first glance. In this post, for example, I explained how rephrasing of Turkish sentences is quite logical indeed.<br \/><br \/>",

Mereka tahu itu adalah buruk bagi mereka dan semua, tapi itu hanya sesuatu yang mereka ingin mencoba. Jadi mereka meminta salah satu teman perokok mereka untuk rokok. Diakui, mereka terlebih dahulu tidak bisa menyala pada mereka sendiri sehingga mereka meminta temannya untuk melakukannya. Kemudian mereka menghirup rokok itu dan merokok kadang-kadang.\nRupanya yang membuat mereka perokok lahir. Sekarang mereka merokok cukup teratur. Mereka tidak dapat menghindari merokok dan mereka menikmati juga. Mereka memiliki teman-teman perokok. Sehari-hari mereka membawa paket di saku mereka. Bagi mereka, satu pak rokok adalah sama pentingnya dengan dompet untuk uang mereka.\nTiba-tiba, karena alasan tertentu, mereka menyadari fakta bahwa tembakau adalah penyebab dari daftar panjang penyakit jahat. Hal ini tidak hanya penyakit jantung, stroke, dan penyakit paru-paru kronis tetapi juga kandung kemih, paru-paru, dan kanker pankreas. Bahkan dilaporkan bahwa sekitar 400.000 orang Amerika meninggal setiap tahun. Itu adalah salah satu setiap 80 detik dari penyakit yang berhubungan dengan tembakau.\nKemudian mereka memutuskan itu adalah bodoh untuk menyakiti diri mereka sendiri. Mereka ingin berhenti merokok. Sayangnya, mereka menemukan bahwa berhenti merokok sangat sulit. \"Mengapa saya tidak dapat berhenti merokok? Aku benar-benar ingin menghentikannya\". Sulit untuk berhenti karena nikotin adalah kuat adiktif. Rokok merupakan salah satu perangkat pengiriman obat yang paling efisien yang pernah disusun. Akibatnya, ketika orang mencoba untuk berhenti merokok, mereka sering mengalami gejala putus nikotin klasik seperti kecemasan, mudah tersinggung, sakit kepala, depresi, dan kegelisahan.\nNah, masih ingin mencoba asap? Pikirkan fakta-fakta sebelum mencoba! Jika Anda bukan seorang perokok, Anda tidak pernah dan tidak harus mencoba untuk merokok.<\/span>",

When they were already in a line, what did Mousedeer do?<br \/>\n8. Finally, could he get to the other side of the river safely?<br \/><br \/>\nini ceritanya<br \/>\nMouse Deer and Crocodile<br \/>\nOne day, Mouse Deer went down to the river to take a drink. But he knew that the crocodile might be waiting underwater to eat him, so he said out loud. \u201cI wonder if the water\u2019s warm. I\u2019ll put in my leg and find out.\u201d Of course Mouse Deer didn\u2019t put in his leg. He picked up a stick instead and put one end into the water. Chomp\u2026! Crocodile grabbed the stick and pulled it underwater. Mouse Deer laughed. \u201cHa\u2026 ha\u2026ha\u2026 Stupid crocodile! Cant you tell the difference between a stick and a leg?\u201d Then Mouse Deer ran off to drink somewhere else.<br \/>\nIn the next day, Mouse Deer wanted to cross the river. He wanted to eat the fruits on the other side of the river. He saw a floating log in the river. He knew that Crocodile looked like a log when he floated.

Have you come to be my lunch?\u201d Mouse Deer smiled. \u201cSorry, not today, Crocodile. I have orders from the King. He wants to invite all the crocodiles in this river to a party.

But he knew that the crocodile might be waiting underwater to eat him, so he said out loud. \u201cI wonder if the water\u2019s warm. I\u2019ll put in my leg and find out.\u201d Of course Mouse Deer didn\u2019t put in his leg. He picked up a stick instead and put one end into the water. Chomp\u2026!

Cant you tell the difference between a stick and a leg?\u201d Then Mouse Deer ran off to drink somewhere else.\nIn the next day, Mouse Deer wanted to cross the river. He wanted to eat the fruits on the other side of the river. He saw a floating log in the river. He knew that Crocodile looked like a log when he floated. Mouse Deer didn\u2019t want to be eaten by Crocodile when he crosses the river. He had an idea. He called out loud, \u201cCrocodile!\u201d Crocodile rose from the water, \u201cHello, Mouse Deer.

Because of that her father got confused. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter my beautiful daughter? Why are you so sad?\u201d asked King Fernando. Charlita was just silent. She did not say anything. Then, King Fernando decided to make a competition to cheer Charlita again. After that, the palace representative announce: \u201cI will make a competition. The aim is to make my daughter, Princess Charlita to be happy and laugh again. Everyone who can do it, will get a prize. It will be held tomorrow when the sun rises. Sign: King Fernando.\u201d The following morning, everybody came to the palace, tried to give their best performance. They seemed happy and laugh, but not for Princess Charlita. She was just silent and still looked sad. King Fernando started to give up. No one amused his daughter. Then, there came a young handsome man. \u201cExcuse me King Fernando. I would like to join your competition. But, would you mind if I took Princess Charlita for a walk?\u201d said the young man gently. \u201cAs long as you make my daughter be happy again, it will totally alright.\u201d said King Fernando.

When one hears about samoene's good news, good luck or achievements, he or she congratulates them. expressing congratulations in english-speaking contries is rather similar to how we express it in our country, althought they might be more expressive. for example mostly express congratulations in personor thought phone calls, our thought text messages o our moblie phones, people in english-speaking coutries often go to some lenght to send congratulatory cards or letter. the recipent will relply in kind<br \/><br \/><br \/>\nhowever, the way indonesian people respond to congratulations is somewhat different. indonesia people tend to refuse the gesture. for example, when an indonesian is congratulated for their victory in a competition. they might respond by saying, \"no it was just smallscale competition\". Responding as such is considered polite because agreeing to the other person might be considered bragging. people in english-speaking countries may also respond to congratulations by refusing it, but they mostly do it by expressing thanks. they do so to appreciate the other person's sincerity in congratulating them<br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/>\nCeritakan kembali menggunakan bahasa sendiri (dalam bahasa inggris)!!!!!!!!!!!!",

When one hears about samoene's good news, good luck or achievements, he or she congratulates them. expressing congratulations in english-speaking contries is rather similar to how we express <em>it<\/em> in our country, althought they might be more expressive. for example mostly express congratulations in personor thought phone calls, our thought text messages o our moblie phones, people in english-speaking coutries often go to some lenght to send congratulatory cards or letter. the recipent will relply in kind\nhowever, the way indonesian people respond to congratulations is somewhat different. indonesia people tend to refuse the gesture. for example, when an indonesian is congratulated for their victory in a competition. they might respond by saying, \"no <em>it<\/em> was <em>just<\/em> smallscale competition\". Responding as such is considered polite because agreeing to the other person might be considered bragging. people in english-speaking countries may also respond to congratulations by refusing <em>it<\/em>, but they mostly <em>do<\/em> <em>it<\/em> by expressing thanks. they <em>do<\/em> so to appreciate the other person's sincerity in congratulating them\nCeritakan kembali menggunakan bahasa sendiri (dalam bahasa inggris)!!!!!!!!!!!!",

Anybody who can move the mosque will get a lot of prizes.\"<br \/><br \/>\nNobody took the offer. The king repeated the announcement many times. Still, nobody spoke. The king looked at the people one by one. His eyes tried to find Abunawas. When he saw him, he asked, \"Abu, what about you?\"<br \/><br \/>\nAbunawas was surprised. But, finally he said, \"I'll move the mosque, but I have a condition, Your Majesty,\" said he.<br \/><br \/>\n\"What is it?\" asked the king.<br \/><br \/>\n\"I'll move the mosque the following Friday, if you hold a feast for us,\" said the smart man.<br \/><br \/>\nNobody spoke. They looked at Abunawas unbelievably. They thought that the task was impossible. They could not imagine how a man could lift up and carry a big mosque.<br \/><br \/>\nThe following Friday, a lot of people were gathering in front of the mosque. They just finished doing the Friday prayer. They joined a big feast there. Everybody was happy.<br \/><br \/>\n\"Abunawas, this is the time you do your job,\" said the king. He continued speaking to the people, \"You all are here to witness an extraordinary thing today. Abunawas will move the mosque to its new place there.\"<br \/><br \/>\nAbunawas cleared his throat and said, \"Brother, King Aaron gave me an order to move the mosque to the orther side of the palace square.\"<br \/><br \/>\nThe crowd mad some noise expressing their disbelief on what they just heard. One of them shouted, \"How will you lift it up, Abu?\"<br \/><br \/>\nAbunawas looked at the man. He smiled and said, \"I will carry it on my shoulder.\"<br \/><br \/>\n\"Okay, Abu. Do it now,\" shouted King Aaron over the noise.<br \/><br \/>\nThe crowd was silent. Nobody dared to speak loudly.<br \/><br \/>\nAbunawas stepped forward to the people. He stood with his legs apart. He bowed to pull his trousers up. He rolled up the sleeves of his shirt. Then he walked to the mosque. Hundreds of people, including the king and the ministers followed him.<br \/><br \/>\nWhen Abunawas came to the side of the mosque, he stopped and murmured something inaudible. Many people took a deep breath.<br \/><br \/>\nAbunawas turned to the people and said, \"Brother, usually when I bring something heavy, I ask for a help to somebody to put it on my shoulder. The mosque is very heavy. Please help me. Lift it up and put in on my shoulder!\"<br \/><br \/>\nEverybody was surprised. They just looked at each other.<br \/><br \/>\n\"Gentlemen, there are around two hundreds of you here. You've just had a big feast! You must be very strong. Please help me!\" said Abunawas again.<br \/><br \/>\nSuddenly one of the ministers said, \"Abu, are you crazy? We will not be able to lift it up!\"<br \/><br \/>\n\"Yes, we won't\" said another one.<br \/><br \/>\nMore and more people shouted the same thing.<br \/><br \/>\nAbunawas said to the king, \"It's not my fault not to move the mosque, Your Majesty.

Malin <br \/>\nKundang and his mother had to live hard because his father had <br \/>\npassed away when he was a baby. Malin Kundang was a healthy, <br \/>\ndilligent, and strong boy. He usually went to sea to catch fish. After <br \/>\ngetting fish he would bring it to his mother, or sell the caught fish <br \/>\nin the town. <br \/>\nOne day, when Malin Kundang was sailing, he saw a <br \/>\nmerchant\u2019s ship being raided by a band of pirates. With his bravery, <br \/>\nMalin Kundang helped the merchant defeat the pirates. To thank <br \/>\nhim, the merchant allowed Malin Kundang to sail with him. Malin <br \/>\nKundang agreed in the hope to get a better life. He left his mother <br \/>\nalone. <br \/>\nMany years later, Malin Kundang became wealthy. He had <br \/>\na huge ship and a lot of crews who worked loading trading goods. <br \/>\nHe was also married to a beautiful woman. When he was sailing <br \/>\non his trading journey, his ship landed on a coast near a small <br \/>\nvillage. The local people recognized that it was Malin Kundang, a <br \/>\nboy from the area. The news ran fast in the town; \u201cMalin Kundang <br \/>\nhas become rich and now he is here\u201d.<br \/>\nAn old woman, who was Malin Kundang\u2019s mother, ran to <br \/>\nthe beach to meet the new rich merchant. She wanted to hug him <br \/>\nto release her sadness of being lonely after a long time. When his <br \/>\nmother came near him, Malin Kundang who was with his beautiful <br \/>\nwife and his ship crews denied that she was his mother. She had <br \/>\npleaded Malin Kundang to look at her and admit that she was her <br \/>\nmother. But he kept refusing to do it and yelling at her. At last <br \/>\nMalin Kundang said to her \u201cEnough, old woman! I have never had a <br \/>\nmother like you, a dirty and ugly woman!\u201d After that he ordered his <br \/>\ncrews to set sail to leave the old woman who was then full of sadness <br \/>\nand anger. Finally, feeling enraged, she cursed Malin Kundang <br \/>\nthat he would turn into a stone if he didn\u2019t apologize to her. Malin <br \/>\nKundang just laughed and set sail. Suddenly a thunderstorm came <br \/>\nin the quiet sea, wrecking his huge ship. He was thrown out to a <br \/>\nsmall island.

(dia juga menikah dg seorg wanita yg cantik)  When\nhe was sailing on his trading journey, his ship\nlanded on a coast near a small village. (ktk dia sedang berlayar pd perjalanan dagangnya, kapalnya mendarat di sebuah pantai di dekat sebuah desa kecil) The\nlocal people recognized that it was Malin\nKundang, a boy from the area.

(akhirnya merasa tdk dihargai, dia mengutuk malin kundang bhw dia akan berubah menjadi sebua batu jika dia tdk meminta maaf kpd ibunya). \nMalin Kundang just laughed and set sail. (malin kundang hny tertawa dan bersiap berlayar). \nSuddenly a thunderstorm came in the quiet\nsea, wrecking his huge ship.

Malin Kundang dan ibunya harus bekerja keras karena ayahnya sudah meninggal waktu dia bayi. Malin Kundang adalah anak (laki\")  yang sehat, cerdas, dan kuat. Biasanya dia pergi untuk mencari ikan. Setelah memdapatkan ikan, dia akan membawa pulang ikan itu ke ibunya atau menjualnya ke kota.<br \/><br \/>Suatu hari, saat malin kundang berlayar, dia melihat kapal pedagang yang tengah  diserang oleh sekelompok pembajak. Dengan keberaniannya, malin kundang membantu pedagang itu untuk menyerang balik si pembajak. Untuk bentuk terima kasih,  pedagang itu membolehkan Malin kundang untuk ikut berlayar bersamanya. Malin Kundamg pun menerima tawaran tersebut dengan harapan mendapatkan kehidupan yang lebih baik. dia meninggalkan ibunya seorang diri.<br \/><br \/>Beberapa tahun setelahnya, Malin Kundang menjadi kaya. Dia mempunyai kapal besar dan mempunyai banyak awak kapal yang bekerja untuk berdagang. Dia juga menikahi wanita cantik. Ketika dia berlayar dalam perjalaan untuk berdagang, dia berlabuh pada tepi pantai dekat desa kecil. Warga desa tersebut mengenali siapa yang melabuhkan kapalnya, yaitu Malin Kundang. <br \/><br \/>Berita menyebar begitu cepat, \" Malin Kundamg sekarang telah menjadi Pria yang kaya dan sekarang berada di sini!\"<br \/>Ibu Malin Kundang senang bukan main. Dia berlari ke tepi pantai untuk bertemu dengan anaknya. Dia ingin memeluknya untuk melepaskan kesedihan karena sendiri dalam waktu yang lama.<br \/><br \/> Saat dia mendekati, Malin Kundang yang bersama dengan istri dan awak kapalnya menentang bahwa wanita tua itu adalah ibunya. Ibunya pun memelas dan menyuruh malin kundang untuk menatap matanya dan mengakui bahwa dia adalah ibunya. Tetapi, Malin Kundang tetap menolak dan membentak ibunya. Akhirmya, Malin Kundang berkata, \"cukup, wanita tua! Aku tidak akan pernah punya ibu yang sepertimu, wanita jelek dan kotor!\"<br \/><br \/>setelah itu, Malin Kundang menyuruh awak kapalnya agar berlayar meninggalkan wanita tua itu. Dengan penuh kesedihan dan amarah, wanita tua itu mengutuk Malin Kundang agar menjadi batu jika Malin Kundang tidak meminta maaf kepadanya. Malin Kundang pun tertawa dan bersiap untuk berlayar. <br \/><br \/>Tiba - tiba, badai petir datang dan menghancurkan kapal besarnya. Malin Kundang terpental ke pulau kecil. Sudah terlalu terlambat untuk menghindari kutukannya; dia sudah menjadi batu.<br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/>Maaf, kak. kalau kalimat langsung atau tidak langsungnya aku kurang ngerti...<br \/>",

Malin Kundang dan ibunya harus hidup keras karena ayahnya sudah meninggal saat ia masih bayi. Malin Kundang adalah anak laki-laki yang sehat, dilligent, dan kuat. Ia biasanya pergi ke laut untuk menangkap ikan. Setelah mendapatkan ikan ia akan membawanya ke ibunya, atau menjual ikan tangkapan di kota.<br \/>Suatu hari, saat Malin Kundang sedang berlayar, dia melihat sebuah kapal pedagang digerebek oleh sekelompok bajak laut. Dengan keberaniannya, Malin Kundang membantu pedagang tersebut mengalahkan bajak laut. Untuk berterima kasih padanya, pedagang tersebut mengizinkan Malin Kundang untuk berlayar bersamanya. Malin Kundang setuju dengan harapan bisa mendapatkan kehidupan yang lebih baik. Dia meninggalkan ibunya sendirian.<br \/>Bertahun-tahun kemudian, Malin Kundang menjadi kaya raya. Dia memiliki kapal besar dan banyak awak yang bekerja memuat barang dagang. Ia juga menikahi wanita cantik. Saat berlayar dalam perjalanan perdagangannya, kapalnya mendarat di sebuah pantai dekat sebuah desa kecil. Orang-orang setempat menyadari bahwa Malin Kundang, anak laki-laki dari daerah itu. Berita itu cepat terjadi di kota; \"Malin Kundang telah menjadi kaya dan sekarang dia ada di sini\".<br \/>Seorang wanita tua, ibu Malin Kundang, berlari ke pantai untuk menemui pedagang kaya baru itu. Dia ingin memeluknya untuk melepaskan kesedihannya karena kesepian setelah sekian lama. Saat ibunya mendekatinya, Malin Kundang yang bersama istrinya yang cantik dan awak kapal membantah bahwa dia adalah ibunya. Dia telah memohon kepada Malin Kundang untuk menatapnya dan mengakui bahwa dia adalah ibunya. Tapi dia terus menolak untuk melakukannya dan meneriakinya. Akhirnya Malin Kundang berkata kepadanya \"Cukup, wanita tua! Saya tidak pernah memiliki ibu seperti Anda, wanita yang kotor dan jelek! \"Setelah itu dia memerintahkan awak kapal untuk berlayar meninggalkan wanita tua yang saat itu penuh dengan kesedihan dan kemarahan. Akhirnya, merasa marah, dia mengutuk Malin Kundang bahwa dia akan berubah menjadi batu jika dia tidak meminta maaf kepadanya. Malin Kundang hanya tertawa dan berlayar. Tiba-tiba badai terjadi di laut yang sepi, menghancurkan kapal besarnya. Dia dilempar ke sebuah pulau kecil. Sudah sangat terlambat baginya untuk menghindari kutukannya; Dia telah berubah menjadi batu<br \/><br \/>Jawablah pertanyaan yg ada di gambar",

She went to take a bath, took off her necklace and hung it on a took. A crow came and flew off with the necklace. When the bird found out that the necklace was not edible,\u00a0 he dropped it down. The necklace fell from the sky and dropped on to a tree. Under that tree, there is a flowing river in which all the dirt of the city was floating. Very dirty ,when the queen came out of her bath; she saw the necklace was missing. She cried, \u201c a thief has take my necklace!\u201d\u00a0 was,that crow a real thief ? she never knew, but still she said, \u201c a thief has taken my necklace and I won\u2019t eat any food until I get it back.\u201d Now, nobody could find the necklace and the king offered that whoever would find that necklace and bring it to him, he would give half of his kingdom.<br \/><br \/>Some travelers were going by and they stopped under the tree to shelter and looked into that dirty river. \u201coh there is the necklace , \u201cthey cried, \u201cnow let us jump in to the water and take it out,\u201dso they all jumped in to the river and swam deep, but they could not get anything. They came out and again saw the necklace was there. So, again, they jumped in but still did not get anything. Again and again they jumped in and came out from the river. Every time they came out they still saw it. So they thought, \u201cthat thief is very clever. Whenever we come out he shows us the necklace but when we jump in he takes and hides it. He is very clever.\u201d<br \/><br \/>After some time a huge crowd gathered, the king was passing and said, \u201cwhat is the matter ? what are they doing up there by the river ?\u201d the people said, there is a necklace, your majesty !\u201d the king said, \u201cthat is a necklace my wife is looking for.
