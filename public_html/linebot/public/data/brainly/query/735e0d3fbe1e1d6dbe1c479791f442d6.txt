I almost forget my identity.<br \/>\n\tI arrived at the airport in the afternoon. The flight was not really good. So I only had a little sleep. Nobody picked me up, so I took a taxi to the hotel. I asked the driver to take me to the hotel my agent had reserved.<br \/>\n\tAt the hotel I went directly to the receptionist desk. I told her that I had reserved a room. After a minute she looked at me and said that nobody had reserved under Jack Baner. And the hotel was full. I thought there was something wrong. But what could I do?<br \/>\n\tThen I went to a public phone. I called my travel agent back at my country and told about my problem. I was surprised to know that the problem was so simple. They reserved a room at this hotel under Johny Goodbye, my alias. I am a secret agent, remember?<br \/>\n\tI was so embarrassed. I shouldn\u2019t have forgotten my alias.<br \/><br \/>\n1. what is the purpose of the story? to entertain or to inform the readers?<br \/>\n2.who is the writer?<br \/>\n3.what kind of text is it?

I almost forget <em>my<\/em> identity.\n\tI arrived at the airport in the afternoon. The flight was not really good. So I only had a little sleep. Nobody picked me up, so I took a taxi to the hotel. I asked the driver to take me to the hotel <em>my<\/em> <em>age<\/em>nt had reserved.\n\tAt the hotel I went directly to the receptionist desk. I told her that I had reserved a room. After a minute she looked at me and said that nobody had reserved under Jack Baner. And the hotel was full. I thought there was something wrong. But what could I do?\n\tThen I went to a public phone. I called <em>my<\/em> travel <em>age<\/em>nt back at <em>my<\/em> country and told about <em>my<\/em> problem. I was surprised to know that the problem was so simple.

The couple was very rich but people in the village excluded them from all social activities.<br \/>\n Despite his wealth, Pan Balang Tamak never did anything good for his fellow villagers. He was very clever at cheating people.<br \/>\n One day, Kelian Banjar, the village chief, ordered the villagers, including Pan Balang Tamak, to begin renovating the Bale Kulkul, a building that acted as the centerpiece of the village.<br \/>\n The people were told to go to the nearby forest to collect wood and other building materials. The chief ordered all members of the village to begin work before sunrise, right after their chickens had left their roosts. Any latecomers would be fined.<br \/>\nThe next morning, all the male villagers except Pan Balang Tamak went to the forest at dawn and began collecting wood.<br \/>\nReturning from the forest at noon, the villagers met Pan Balang Tamak, who looked at them innocently. The village chief was furious and planned to make him pay a large fine.<br \/>\nBut Pan Balang Tamak was ready with an answer. \"You told me that we had to go to the forest after our chickens came down from their roosts,\" he said confidently.<br \/>\n\"My chickens left their roosts just a few minutes ago and that's why I'm heading for the forest now,\" he said. The chief could do nothing but rub his face in despair when he heard Pan Balang Tamak's argument, which was logically correct.<br \/>\nA week later, the villagers were instructed to go hunting in the forest. Each man was ordered to bring along a strong and fierce dog that could bark and climb trees. Anyone who brought a small, weak dog would once again face a fine. Ignoring this instruction, Pan Balang Tamak appeared with a small, skinny dog. The villagers assumed that he would surely have to pay a fine this time.<br \/>\nNever short of ideas and tricks, Pan Balang Tamak went hunting with his old dog. Arriving in the forest, he threw his dog up into a tall tree. The dog was in pain and barked loudly.<br \/>\nPan Balang Tamak was happy and called out to his friends, shouting, \"Look at my dog. It is very brave and is able to catch a deer, even though the animal finally managed to escape.\"<br \/>\nThe villagers became very angry and went home straight away with sour expressions on their faces.<br \/>\nUnable to trap Pan Balang Tamak, the villagers reported the case to Dewa Agung Klungkung, the king of Klungkung kingdom. Hearing the report, the king was furious and immediately ordered his servant to poison Pan Balang Tamak.<br \/><br \/>\nPan Balang Tamak knew he would be finished soon. He knew that he had been poisoned. He asked his wife to follow his instructions while he awaited death. Pan Balang Tamak died while eating his final meal. His wife dressed his body in a white robe and placed it against a pillar of their bale (open building). She also untied her husband's hair and spread it over his shoulders, like a holy man did when praying. Above his head, she hung a cage filled with bees.<br \/>\nThe villagers were very curious and went to Pan Balang Tamak's house to make sure that he had in fact died. But they were startled to find that the man sitting up and chanting a mantra (which was actually the sound of the bees) was Pan Balang Tamak. They ran to the palace and reported it to the king. Curious, the king wondered whether the poison had been strong enough to kill Pan Balang Tamak. He then swallowed the poison himself and died.<br \/>\nThe relationship between the folk tale and the establishment of Pan Balang Tamak shrines remains unclear. Many people differentiate between Pan Balang Tamak as he is presented in the folk tale and his depiction on the shrines. They were not the same person.<br \/>\nLow Hindu priest Mangku Pande Made Tastra, a spiritual leader from Nongan village, explained that the establishment of shrines dedicated to Pan Balang Tamak would suggest that he had in fact existed.<br \/>\n\"We can trace some of his roots in Nongan village,\" the Mangku (low priest) said. People in the village are still arguing whether a spacious house done in a rich Balinese architectural style actually belonged to the famous folk hero.<br \/>\nPan Balang Tamak is also thought to have left behind numerous gold bars and coins. Believe it or not, he is now regarded as half deity and half holy man.",

The villagers assumed that he would surely have to pay a fine this time.\nNever short of ideas and tricks, Pan Balang Tamak went hunting with his old dog. Arriving in the forest, he threw his dog up into a tall tree. The dog was in pain and barked loudly.\nPan Balang Tamak was happy and called out to his friends, shouting, \"Look at <em>my<\/em> dog. It is very brave and is able to catch a deer, even though the animal finally managed to escape.\"\nThe villagers became very angry and went home straight away with sour expressions on their faces.\nUnable to trap Pan Balang Tamak, the villagers reported the case to Dewa Agung Klungkung, the king of Klungkung kingdom. Hearing the report, the king was furious and immediately ordered his servant to poison Pan Balang Tamak.\nPan Balang Tamak knew he would be finished soon. He knew that he had been poisoned. He asked his wife to follow his instructions while he awaited death. Pan Balang Tamak died while eating his final meal. His wife dressed his body in a white robe and placed it against a pillar of their bale (open building). She also untied her husband's hair and spread it over his shoulders, like a holy man did when praying. Above his head, she hung a cage filled with bees.\nThe villagers were very curious and went to Pan Balang Tamak's house to make sure that he had in fact died. But they were startled to find that the man sitting up and chanting a mantra (which was actually the sound of the bees) was Pan Balang Tamak. They ran to the palace and reported it to the king. Curious, the king wondered whether the poison had been strong enough to kill Pan Balang Tamak. He then swallowed the poison himself and died.\nThe relationship between the folk tale and the establishment of Pan Balang Tamak shrines remains unclear. Many people differentiate between Pan Balang Tamak as he is presented in the folk tale and his depiction on the shrines. They were not the same person.\nLow Hindu priest Mangku Pande Made Tastra, a spiritual leader from Nongan village, explained that the establishment of shrines dedicated to Pan Balang Tamak would suggest that he had in fact existed.\n\"We can trace some of his roots in Nongan village,\" the Mangku (low priest) said. People in the village are still arguing whether a spacious house done in a rich Balinese architectural style actually belonged to the famous folk hero.\nPan Balang Tamak is also thought to have left behind numerous gold bars and coins. Believe it or not, he is now regarded as half deity and half holy man.",

Tertarik dengan warnanya,saya mengambilnya,lalu fanny dan saya membacanya. Kami saya kaget,itu adalah kupon 4 malam tur ke lombok!! hari kadaluarsanya hari itu. mengejutkan kami,sama seperti fanny teman saya,dan itu juga berlaku untuk dua orang. Itu bagus!! Kami berfikir itu mungkin kupon jatuh dari langit dan untuk kami. <br \/>Kami buru-buru ke alamat tur agen itu mengecek kupon. Tur agen menyiapkan semuanya. Kita sampai di rumah dan masih tidak percaya itu. 2 hari kemudian kami berada di pantai senggigi,berbaring di bawah matahari yg panas. Selain itu,kita mempunyai liburan publik yang panjang,jadi kami bisa menikmati \"hadiah\" dengan senang. Kami juga membeli beberapa kado untuk keluarga dan teman kami. <br \/><br \/>(Ada bbrp teks yg typo d cerita d ats tp ak prbaiki dan mngrti. smoga membantu)",

Then, while I was swimming, suddenly they gave me a birthday surprise by bringing a cake. I was very surprised because they acted like there was nothing special on that day. And then they sang a birthday song and I blew out the candles. Unexpectedly, my bestfriend pushed me into the pool and put the cream cake on my face so my face looked like a clown. They gave me great wishes. After that I took a bath and cleaned up the cream in my face. But The birthday surprise didn't end yet, they gave me a birthday gift. What a lovely day!",

Books are the chief source that provides knowledge, information and entertainment to your mind. Books brighten our ideas. People think that they can get more knowledge from the T.V and the films. But in my opinion the best knowledge is stored in books written by master minded geniuses. Books are our best guides and honest friends.<br \/>\nReading gives much pleasure. I can enjoy the company of great writers by reading their works can learn from them good and noble things of life. Goods books are friends. They contain the wisdom of ages.

SCHOOLCRAFT (ADAPTED)<br \/><br \/>\nAn old man was sitting in his lodge, by the side<br \/>\nof a frozen stream. It was the end of winter, the<br \/>\nair was not so cold, and his fire was nearly out. <br \/>\nHe was old and alone. His locks were white with<br \/>\nage, and he trembled in every joint. Day after<br \/>\nday passed, and he heard nothing but the sound<br \/>\nof the storm sweeping before it the new-fallen<br \/>\nsnow.<br \/><br \/>\nOne day while his fire was dying, a handsome<br \/>\nyoung man approached and entered the lodge. <br \/>\nHis cheeks were red, his eyes sparkled. He<br \/>\nwalked with a quick, light step. His forehead was<br \/>\nbound with a wreath of sweet-grass, and he<br \/>\ncarried a bunch of fragrant flowers in his hand.<br \/><br \/>\n``Ah, my son,'' said the old man, ``I am happy<br \/>\nto see you. Come in! Tell me your adventures,<br \/>\nand what strange lands you have seen. I will tell<br \/>\nyou of my wonderful deeds, and what I can<br \/>\nperform. You shall do the same, and we will amuse<br \/>\neach other.''<br \/><br \/>\nThe old man then drew from a bag a curiously<br \/>\nwrought pipe. He filled it with mild tobacco, and<br \/>\nhanded it to his guest. They each smoked from<br \/>\nthe pipe and then began their stories.<br \/><br \/>\n``I am Peboan, the Spirit of Winter,'' said the<br \/>\nold man. ``I blow my breath, and the streams<br \/>\nstand still. The water becomes stiff and hard as<br \/>\nclear stone.''<br \/><br \/>\n``I am Seegwun, the Spirit of Spring,'' answered<br \/>\nthe youth. ``I breathe, and flowers spring up in<br \/>\nthe meadows and woods.''<br \/><br \/>\n``I shake my locks,'' said the old man, ``and<br \/>\nsnow covers the land. The leaves fall from the<br \/>\ntrees, and my breath blows them away. The<br \/>\nbirds fly to a distant land, and the animals hide<br \/>\nthemselves from the cold.''<br \/><br \/>\n``I shake my ringlets,'' said the young man,<br \/>\n``and warm showers of soft rain fall upon the<br \/>\nearth. The flowers lift their heads from the<br \/>\nground, the grass grows thick and green. My<br \/>\nvoice recalls the birds, and they come flying<br \/>\njoyfully from the Southland. The warmth of my<br \/>\nbreath unbinds the streams, and they sing the<br \/>\nsongs of summer. Music fills the groves where-<br \/>\never I walk, and all nature rejoices.''<br \/><br \/>\nAnd while they were talking thus a wonderful<br \/>\nchange took place. The sun began to rise. A gentle<br \/>\nwarmth stole over the place. Peboan, the<br \/>\nSpirit of Winter, became silent. His head drooped,<br \/>\nand the snow outside the lodge melted away. <br \/>\nSeegwun, the Spirit of Spring, grew more radiant,<br \/>\nand rose joyfully to his feet. The robin and<br \/>\nthe bluebird began to sing on the top of the lodge. <br \/>\nThe stream began to murmur at the door, and<br \/>\nthe fragrance of opening flowers came softly on<br \/>\nthe breeze.<br \/><br \/>\nThe lodge faded away, and Peboan sank down<br \/>\nand dissolved into tiny streams of water, that<br \/>\nvanished under the brown leaves of the forest. <br \/>\nThus the Spirit of Winter departed, and where<br \/>\nhe had melted away, there the Indian children<br \/>\ngathered the first blossoms, fragrant and<br \/>\ndelicately pink,--the modest Spring Beauty.<br \/><br \/>\nQuestions :<br \/>\n1.

My baby will not survive. My baby will not survive. My baby ....<br \/>\n \tAnd then he became not a baby anymore. He has become like any other toddler. He shouted \"No, no, no\" with all his strength. He swallowed his apple sauce already mixed with the medicine. He watched Little Bear of the DVD during therapy sessions three times a day (patting his chest and then re-emit thick sputum for cough - cough). He ran from me while naked and pee on the floor. He sometimes - sometimes had to be hospitalized and intravenously. He's adorable. He was naughty. He did need extra care to stay healthy, but certainly he will not survive.<br \/>\n \tRepeatedly in the hospital for many - years must hinder the development - developments in the growth mentioned by experts to scare - scare inexperienced parents; They also mentioned the importance of a variety of other developments, which are much more complex to achieve child in size - the size except the things - important things for a pleasant life. My son is already manifest desire to run, who cares about when it's time? He was also a fighter and powerful. He also obtained his black belt, memangnya important to me when a child - another kid got it early? Achievement - indeed overdue achievement than children - other children, but he kept trying. He was able to play his cards well, as we all do. I must admit that the parents of children - children who get chronic diseases feeling - a feeling of excessive pride and shame for the victory - kemenanangan child. They are much sweeter. Higher value. Achievement, I think, should be measured as well in terms of depth and height. Thanks to the CF.<br \/>\n \tSlowly - land, after many - years, how - our view is changing.<br \/>\n \tSessions - therapy sessions lungs - lungs, which originally was pleasan burdensome, has now formed a closeness between us that was until now. High nutritional standards, which once seemed as stress, has forced me to do some research and hone skills kulinerku. Logistics deadlock due to enter hospital, which originally was confusing has created a certain level of comfort in such situations. Anxiety - anxiety that is inevitable, such as depression, requires us to discuss the topic - the topic that weight. With this wisdom appreciate the variety of our family so much more alive, ranging from cooking better and stronger body to the conversation more excited and more relaxed lifestyle. We have children - other children and more to spend on ice cream. We dig deeper faith, seek - find strength and find purpose, and comfort more meaningful. Are we becoming more grieving? Certainly. However, we become wiser and more understanding. Thanks to the CF.<br \/>\n \tAre we becoming more grieving? Certainly. However, we become wiser and more understanding. Thanks to the CF.<br \/>\n \tWhat does it mean we just run the wisdom and everything was sorted out by itself? We wrote a letter - a letter to appeal for research funding; we work as a volunteer in various fund-raising events; we also signed and follow the demo studies and surveys; and we talk in public. There we know more and some that we know a little more. In certain cases, our world becomes narrowed to just our family; in the case of - certain other things our world extends include other people, organizations, and ideals - ideals. Thanks to the CF.<br \/>\n \tNow at the age of seventeen and the oldest of seven children, she became the darling of the family. All the kids think is cool. They are tempted by the delicious snack before bed; drinks, and cakes - pastries and yogurt is always a tray full. When he needed an IV and was hospitalized for two minggum they all envy him; she had her own television in his room! He should get whatever he wants food that is directly delivered to him. He's been usual to inject herself! We made a rota to set who maintain and when, to make sure nobody who did not get visited him the elder brother. He is the king. Thanks to the CF.<br \/>\n \tSo we were looking forward and donate for the treatment, and in the meantime, we live a normal life and fun. Every person, whether he is suffering from CF or not, should continue to march forward bearing problems and gift each - each. Sometimes - sometimes it's more of a goose step tiptoe - hopscotch. Or just with a bayonet, or the need to rely on a friend - a friend. We push ourselves to the direction of the current; we see others that way today. Thanks to the CF.<br \/><br \/><br \/>",

He has become like any other toddler. He shouted \"No, no, no\" with all his strength. He swallowed his apple sauce already mixed with the medicine. He watched Little Bear of the DVD during therapy sessions three times a day (patting his chest and then re-emit thick sputum for cough - cough). He ran from me while naked and pee on the floor. He sometimes - sometimes had to be hospitalized and intravenously. He's adorable. He was naughty. He did need extra care to stay healthy, but certainly he will not survive.\n \tRepeatedly in the hospital for many - years must hinder the development - developments in the growth mentioned by experts to scare - scare inexperienced parents; They also mentioned the importance of a variety of other developments, which are much more complex to achieve child in size - the size except the things - important things for a pleasant life. <em>My<\/em> son is already manifest desire to run, who cares about when it's time? He was also a fighter and powerful. He also obtained his black belt, memangnya important to me when a child - another kid got it early? Achievement - indeed overdue achievement than children - other children, but he kept trying. He was able to play his cards well, as we all do. I must admit that the parents of children - children who get chronic diseases feeling - a feeling of excessive pride and shame for the victory - kemenanangan child. They are much sweeter. Higher value. Achievement, I think, should be measured as well in terms of depth and height. Thanks to the CF.\n \tSlowly - land, after many - years, how - our view is changing.\n \tSessions - therapy sessions lungs - lungs, which originally was pleasan burdensome, has now formed a closeness between us that was until now. High nutritional standards, which once seemed as stress, has forced me to do some research and hone skills kulinerku. Logistics deadlock due to enter hospital, which originally was confusing has created a certain level of comfort in such situations. Anxiety - anxiety that is inevitable, such as depression, requires us to discuss the topic - the topic that weight. With this wisdom appreciate the variety of our family so much more alive, ranging from cooking better and stronger body to the conversation more excited and more relaxed lifestyle. We have children - other children and more to spend on ice cream. We dig deeper faith, seek - find strength and find purpose, and comfort more meaningful. Are we becoming more grieving? Certainly. However, we become wiser and more understanding. Thanks to the CF.\n \tAre we becoming more grieving? Certainly. However, we become wiser and more understanding. Thanks to the CF.\n \tWhat does it mean we just run the wisdom and everything was sorted out by itself? We wrote a letter - a letter to appeal for research funding; we work as a volunteer in various fund-raising events; we also signed and follow the demo studies and surveys; and we talk in public. There we know more and some that we know a little more. In certain cases, our world becomes narrowed to just our family; in the case of - certain other things our world extends include other people, organizations, and ideals - ideals. Thanks to the CF.\n \tNow at the <em>age<\/em> of seventeen and the oldest of seven children, she became the darling of the family. All the kids think is cool. They are tempted by the delicious snack before bed; drinks, and cakes - pastries and yogurt is always a tray full. When he needed an IV and was hospitalized for two minggum they all envy him; she had her own television in his room! He should get whatever he wants food that is directly delivered to him. He's been usual to inject herself! We made a rota to set who maintain and when, to make sure nobody who did not get visited him the elder brother. He is the king. Thanks to the CF.\n \tSo we were looking forward and donate for the treatment, and in the meantime, we live a normal life and fun. Every person, whether he is suffering from CF or not, should continue to march forward bearing problems and gift each - each. Sometimes - sometimes it's more of a goose step tiptoe - hopscotch. Or just with a bayonet, or the need to rely on a friend - a friend. We push ourselves to the direction of the current; we see others that way today. Thanks to the CF.",

Come in! Tell me your adventures,<br \/>\nand what strange lands you have seen. I will tell<br \/>\nyou of my wonderful deeds, and what I can<br \/>\nperform. You shall do the same, and we will amuse<br \/>\neach other.''<br \/><br \/>\nThe old man then drew from a bag a curiously<br \/>\nwrought pipe. He filled it with mild tobacco, and<br \/>\nhanded it to his guest. They each smoked from<br \/>\nthe pipe and then began their stories.<br \/><br \/>\n``I am Peboan, the Spirit of Winter,'' said the<br \/>\nold man. ``I blow my breath, and the streams<br \/>\nstand still. The water becomes stiff and hard as<br \/>\nclear stone.''<br \/><br \/>\n``I am Seegwun, the Spirit of Spring,'' answered<br \/>\nthe youth. ``I breathe, and flowers spring up in<br \/>\nthe meadows and woods.''<br \/><br \/>\n``I shake my locks,'' said the old man, ``and<br \/>\nsnow covers the land. The leaves fall from the<br \/>\ntrees, and my breath blows them away. The<br \/>\nbirds fly to a distant land, and the animals hide<br \/>\nthemselves from the cold.''<br \/><br \/>\n``I shake my ringlets,'' said the young man,<br \/>\n``and warm showers of soft rain fall upon the<br \/>\nearth. The flowers lift their heads from the<br \/>\nground, the grass grows thick and green. My<br \/>\nvoice recalls the birds, and they come flying<br \/>\njoyfully from the Southland. The warmth of my<br \/>\nbreath unbinds the streams, and they sing the<br \/>\nsongs of summer. Music fills the groves where-<br \/>\never I walk, and all nature rejoices.''<br \/><br \/>\nAnd while they were talking thus a wonderful<br \/>\nchange took place. The sun began to rise. A gentle<br \/>\nwarmth stole over the place. Peboan, the<br \/>\nSpirit of Winter, became silent. His head drooped,<br \/>\nand the snow outside the lodge melted away. <br \/>\nSeegwun, the Spirit of Spring, grew more radiant,<br \/>\nand rose joyfully to his feet. The robin and<br \/>\nthe bluebird began to sing on the top of the lodge. <br \/>\nThe stream began to murmur at the door, and<br \/>\nthe fragrance of opening flowers came softly on<br \/>\nthe breeze.<br \/><br \/>\nThe lodge faded away, and Peboan sank down<br \/>\nand dissolved into tiny streams of water, that<br \/>\nvanished under the brown leaves of the forest. <br \/>\nThus the Spirit of Winter departed, and where<br \/>\nhe had melted away, there the Indian children<br \/>\ngathered the first blossoms, fragrant and<br \/>\ndelicately pink,--the modest Spring Beauty.",

SCHOOLCRAFT (ADAPTED)  An \nAn old man was sitting in his lodge, by the side\nof a frozen stream. It was the end of winter, the\nair was not so cold, and his fire was nearly out. \nHe was old and alone. His locks were white with\n<em>age<\/em>, and he trembled in every joint. Day after\nday passed, and he heard nothing but the sound\nof the storm sweeping before it the new-fallen\nsnow.\nOne day while his fire was dying, a handsome\nyoung man approached and entered the lodge. \nHis cheeks were red, his eyes sparkled. He\nwalked with a quick, light step. His forehead was\nbound with a wreath of sweet-grass, and he\ncarried a bunch of fragrant flowers in his hand.\n``Ah, <em>my<\/em> son,'' said the old man, ``I am happy\nto see you. Come in! Tell me your adventures,\nand what strange lands you have seen. I will tell\nyou of <em>my<\/em> wonderful deeds, and what I can\nperform. You shall do the same, and we will amuse\neach other.''\nThe old man then drew from a bag a curiously\nwrought pipe. He filled it with mild tobacco, and\nhanded it to his guest. They each smoked from\nthe pipe and then began their stories.\n``I am Peboan, the Spirit of Winter,'' said the\nold man. ``I blow <em>my<\/em> breath, and the streams\nstand still. The water becomes stiff and hard as\nclear stone.''\n``I am Seegwun, the Spirit of Spring,'' answered\nthe youth. ``I breathe, and flowers spring up in\nthe meadows and woods.''\n``I shake <em>my<\/em> locks,'' said the old man, ``and\nsnow covers the land. The leaves fall from the\ntrees, and <em>my<\/em> breath blows them away. The\nbirds fly to a distant land, and the animals hide\nthemselves from the cold.''\n``I shake <em>my<\/em> ringlets,'' said the young man,\n``and warm showers of soft rain fall upon the\nearth. The flowers lift their heads from the\nground, the grass grows thick and green. <em>My<\/em>\nvoice recalls the birds, and they come flying\njoyfully from the Southland. The warmth of <em>my<\/em>\nbreath unbinds the streams, and they sing the\nsongs of summer. Music fills the groves where-\never I walk, and all nature rejoices.''\nAnd while they were talking thus a wonderful\nchange took place. The sun began to rise. A gentle\nwarmth stole over the place. Peboan, the\nSpirit of Winter, became silent. His head drooped,\nand the snow outside the lodge melted away. \nSeegwun, the Spirit of Spring, grew more radiant,\nand rose joyfully to his feet. The robin and\nthe bluebird began to sing on the top of the lodge. \nThe stream began to murmur at the door, and\nthe fragrance of opening flowers came softly on\nthe breeze.\nThe lodge faded away, and Peboan sank down\nand dissolved into tiny streams of water, that\nvanished under the brown leaves of the forest. \nThus the Spirit of Winter departed, and where\nhe had melted away, there the Indian children\ngathered the first blossoms, fragrant and\ndelicately pink,--the modest Spring Beauty.",
