Ibu, akulah anakmu yang tak berguna, aku hanya bisa membuatmu larut dalam kesedihan. Anakmu ini hanya bisa membuatmu kecewa dengan segala yang aku lakukan, aku hanya membuatmu marah akan segala kesalahanku. Maafkan aku Ibu, aku tahu aku salah akan hal itu, tapi aku tak bisa mengendalikan semuanya yang telah terjadi. Ibu, maafkan ke khilafan anakmu ini bu, karena aku hanya manusia yang jauh dari kesempurnaan. Ibu, do\u2019aku selalu menyertaimu dalam setiap shalatku, anakmu ini hanya mampu memberimu do\u2019a, anakmu ini memang tak berguna, anakmu ini tak bisa berbuat banyak untukmu selain do\u2019a. Semoga Ibu diberikan waktu yang lebih lama dibumi, sehingga anakmu ini bisa mengabdi lebih lama lagi pada Ibu. Ibu, semoga dirimu diberikan umur yang panjang, sehingga anakmu ini bisa lebih lama lagi tinggal bersama Ibu. Ibu, aku ingin sekali membawamu keTanah Suci, tapi apa dayaku, tak bisa mewujudkan keinginan untuk membawa Ibu ke tempat Kiblat kita. Ibu, terimakasih karena Ibu telah membuatku menjadi orang yang begitu sempurna, walau tidak ada manusia yang sempurna didunia ini. Ibu, terimakasih karena Ibu telah mengajarkan arti kesabaran kepadaku. Terimaksih karena ibu telah mengajarkan banyak hal tentang hidup yang sebenarnya padaku. Ibu, semua terasa indah, saat kita bersama walau terkadang aku salah didepanmu, namun tak dapat kupungkiri kalau aku tak bisa hidup tanpa Ibu. Ibu adalah segalanya bagiku. Ibu, aku tahu kau melahirkanku dengan susah payah sambil menjerit. Ibu, aku tahu kau telah bersusah payah untuk merawatku. Maafkan aku Ibu jika aku tidak bisa membuat Ibu bahagia. Ibu, apabila aku mati, jangan mandikan aku dengan air matamu itu. Ibu, apabila aku terkubur, maka kuburlah aku dalam hatimu bu. Aku menyayangimu bu, Aku begitu mencintaimu bu, Aku sangat merindukanmu Ibu. Ibu adalah Surga Terindah dalam hidupku. Ibu, kau telah merawatku dari aku masih dalam kandungan Ibu hingga sekarang ini. Ibu, aku tidak tahu apa yang harus aku berikan padamu untuk membalas semuanya yang telah Ibu berikan padaku. Aku Sayang Ibu. Ibu, aku tidak akan membiarkanmu terluka, kecewa, dan menagis, karena setetes air mata Ibu yang jatuh adalah kebahagiaanku yang terlukai. Ibu, aku ingin menjadi orang pertama yang ada disamping Ibu. Ibu, jika waktuku tak banyak untuk Ibu, aku ingin disetiap denyutan jantungku terdengar oleh Ibu. Ibu, maafkan aku, jika lidahku pernah menjadi penyayat hatimu, jika boleh aku hanya ingin maaf dan senyum termanis Ibu, yang pernah Ibu berikan padaku. Aku Cinta Ibu. Ibu Dunia Indah yang begitu nyata, aku ingin menghabiskan masa hidupku bersama Ibu. Gelak tawa, candaan, air mata, suka duka, kejenuhan, menemani semua langkahku bersama Ibu. Ibu, begitu banyak memori dan kenangan indah kita. Kini hanyalah sebuah harapan yang terbenam dalam diri. Secerah Sinar Mentari itu menanti untuk digapai agar teraih segala kesempurnaan hidup. TERIMAKASIH IBU, KARENA IBU TELAH MEMBERI WARNA WARNI CINTA DALAM KEHIDUPAN INI. SELAMANYA aku akan tetap Mencintai Ibu, Sampai nanti sampai aku tertidur lelap dibawah timbunan tanah. \u201cI LOVE YOU MOM\u201d <br \/><br \/>tulis kembali surat di atas dengan bahasamu sendiri",

We started to learn language when we were born. However, people are used to speaking their native language, so immigrants are having many problems between the first generation and the second generation because they don't have the same native language. Also, the second generation is losing their identity. Especially in America, there are many immigrants that came from different countries to succeed in the States. Because they suffer in lots of areas such as getting a job and trying to speak English, they want their children to speak English, not only at school, but also at home in order to be more successful. Because of this situation, their children are losing their ethnic identity and, even more, they are ignoring their parents whose English is not very good.<br \/><br \/>\nFor example, my aunt, who has been living in Chicago for fifteen years, has three children and they were all born in the States. The eighteen year old daughter speaks English as a native language and she speaks Korean very well too. She has no problems talking with her parents, but she still doesn't understand Korean jokes, and there are sometimes misunderstandings. The second daughter is fourteen years old, and she doesn't want to speak Korean. My aunt often gets upset with her because she is very Americanized and they cannot understand each other. Even when my aunt punishes her, this daughter does not understand what my aunt is talking about. I felt sympathy for my aunt whenever my fourteen year old cousin said, \"Mom, what is your problem?\" The third child is a twelve year old son. He speaks English to his parents and my aunt speaks Korean to him as she does to the second daughter. He also has a problem communicating with his parents. My aunt is trying to teach him to speak both languages very well, but it is very hard for him because he speaks English all day and does not understand why he should learn to speak Korean.<br \/><br \/>\nI think most immigrants are trying to preserve their native language in their new country, but this doesn't help very much in getting a good job. My aunt didn't teach Korean to her children in order to help them succeed in the U.S.; she did so, hopefully, to help them establish a Korean identity. Though the second generation is born in the new country, they often get confused about their identity because they look different from others, and also, if they visit their parent's country, they will probably feel different from other people there too. My cousins told me that when they visited Korea a few years ago, they felt different from other Koreans. They could even feel it just strolling around the street because they wore different clothes and walked differently.<br \/><br \/>\nWe must realize that language is important and valuable for many reasons. Immigrants should make an effort not to be ignored by their children and to make their children understand their heritage by teaching them the parents' language. This is very important, not only for the harmony of the family, but also in helping the second generation establish their identity.<br \/>\n________________________________________<br \/>\n1\tLook at the title and scan the article quickly.

Berpikir positif dengan kamus besar bahasa Indonesia yang dipikirkan adalah \"menggunakan akal untuk mempertimbangkan dengan baik\" Sedangkan positif berarti \"benar, pasti, dan tegas\". Jadi berpikiran positif adalah menggunakan pikiran untuk hati-hati memikirkan hal-hal dengan benar, pasti, dan tegas.<br \/><br \/>Mengapa berpikir positif perlu? Pemikiran positif memiliki dampak dan pengaruh yang besar dalam kehidupan seseorang. Ketika kita mulai berpikir positif, kekuatan besar datang untuk melakukan hal-hal baik dengan cara yang baik. Misalnya, saat kita menderita, kita terpapar perasaan dendam, marah, dan sedih. Apakah kita lebih suka positif atau negatif.Jika kita memilih pemikiran negatif maka kita akan merasa kesal, marah dan sedih atas penderitaan yang kita terima. Akibatnya kita tidak bisa menyelesaikan masalah tapi mempersulit masalahnya. Namun, ketika kita memilih untuk berpikir positif maka yang terjadi adalah penerimaan dengan cara terbaik. Tidak ada kesedihan dan keputusasaan di dalamnya. Jadi dengan sendirinya, kita akan merasa sangat menghadapi masalah yang kita hadapi.<br \/><br \/>Teman-teman terkasihku,<br \/><br \/>Tahukah Anda bahwa pemikiran positif yang kita timbulkan sendiri akan sangat diuntungkan?<br \/><br \/>Manfaat luar biasa yang meliputi:<br \/><br \/>Bisa mengatasi stres.<br \/>Menjadi lebih percaya diri.<br \/>Punya banyak teman<br \/>Memiliki ketahanan terhadap penyakit.<br \/>Lebih baik secara fisik dan mental.<br \/>Kurangi risiko penyakit jantung.<br \/>Jarang menghadapi depresi.<br \/>Dapat mengatur waktu dengan baik.<br \/>Beranilah.<br \/>Lebih sukses dalam hidup.<br \/>Teman-teman saya, sebelum mengakhiri pidato saya kali ini tolong izinkan saya untuk menyampaikan pantun.<br \/><br \/>Minggu pagi jalan sepi,<br \/><br \/>Beli buah naga dipekalongan ...<br \/><br \/>Pikiran positif tentang kebajikan,<br \/><br \/>Bukti inovasi kemajuan ...<br \/><br \/>Begitulah pidato yang bisa saya sampaikan. Semoga bermanfaat bagi kita semua. Terimakasih atas perhatiannya, mohon maaf jika ada kata-kata yang tidak menyenangkan.",

My beloved friends, Do you know what is meant by positive thinking? Think positive by the big dictionary of Indonesian language that is thinking is \"using reason to consider with good\" While positive means \"true, sure, and firm\". So think positive is to use the mind to carefully consider things correctly, definitely, and firmly. Why is positive thinking necessary? Positive thinking has great impact and influence in one's life. When we start to think positively, great power comes to do good things in a good way. For example, when we are suffering, we are exposed to feelings of resentment, anger, and sadness. Do we prefer positive or negative.Jika we choose negative thinking then we will feel annoyed, angry and sad for the suffering we receive.As a result we can not solve the problem but complicate the problem. However, when we choose to think positively then that happens Is a reception with the best way. There is no sadness and despair in it. So by itself, we will feel strongly facing the problem we are getting. My beloved friends, Do you know that the positive thinking that we cause ourselves will benefit tremendously? Extraordinary benefits that include: Can cope with stress. Become more confident. Have lots of friends. Have a resistance to disease. Better physically and mentally. Reduce the risk of heart disease. Rarely face depression. Can manage time well. Be brave. More success in life. My friends, before I end my speech this time please allow me to convey a pantun.

Segala puji bagi Tuhan marilah kita berdoa kepada Allah untuk berkah dan anugerah dan anugrah yang bisa kita kumpulkan di tempat yang insyaallah dimuliakan. Sholawat serta salam dan jangan lupa mencurahkan kepada nabi besar Muhammad SAW dan kita sebagai bangsanya. Pada kesempatan ini saya akan menyampaikan pidato yang berjudul \"positive thinking\". Teman-teman terkasih saya, tahukah anda apa yang dimaksud dengan pemikiran positif? Berpikir positif dengan kamus besar bahasa Indonesia yang dipikirkan adalah \"menggunakan akal untuk mempertimbangkan dengan baik\" Sedangkan positif berarti \"benar, pasti, dan tegas\". Jadi berpikiran positif adalah menggunakan pikiran untuk hati-hati memikirkan hal-hal dengan benar, pasti, dan tegas. Mengapa berpikir positif perlu? Pemikiran positif memiliki dampak dan pengaruh yang besar dalam kehidupan seseorang. Ketika kita mulai berpikir positif, kekuatan besar datang untuk melakukan hal-hal baik dengan cara yang baik. Misalnya, saat kita menderita, kita terpapar perasaan dendam, marah, dan sedih. Apakah kita lebih suka positif atau negatif.Jika kita memilih pemikiran negatif maka kita akan merasa kesal, marah dan sedih atas penderitaan yang kita terima. Akibatnya kita tidak bisa menyelesaikan masalah tapi mempersulit masalahnya. Namun, ketika kita memilih untuk berpikir positif maka yang terjadi adalah penerimaan dengan cara terbaik. Tidak ada kesedihan dan keputusasaan di dalamnya. Jadi dengan sendirinya, kita akan merasa sangat menghadapi masalah yang kita hadapi. Teman-teman terkasih saya, tahukah Anda bahwa pemikiran positif yang kita sebabkan akan sangat bermanfaat? Manfaat luar biasa itu antara lain: Dapat mengatasi stres. Menjadi lebih percaya diri. Punya banyak teman. Memiliki ketahanan terhadap penyakit. Lebih baik secara fisik dan mental. Kurangi risiko penyakit jantung. Jarang menghadapi depresi. Dapat mengatur waktu dengan baik. Beranilah. Lebih sukses dalam hidup. Teman-teman saya, sebelum mengakhiri pidato saya kali ini tolong izinkan saya untuk menyampaikan pantun.<br \/> Minggu pagi jalan sepi<br \/>Beli buah naga dipekalongan <br \/> Pikiran positif kebajikan, Inovasi bukti kemajuan <br \/> Begitulah ucapan yang bisa saya sampaikan.<br \/> Semoga bermanfaat bagi kita semua. Terimakasih atas perhatiannya, mohon maaf jika ada kata-kata yang tidak menyenangkan.",

For this reason, these storms are sometimes referred to as rotating thunderstorms. Of the four classifications of thunderstorms (supercell, squall line, multi-cell, and single-cell), supercells are the overall least common and have the potential to be the most severe. Supercells are often isolated from other thunderstorms, and can dominate the local weather up to 32 kilometres (20 mil) away.<br \/>\n\u2022Supercells are often put into three classification types: Classic, Low-precipitation (LP), and High-precipitation (HP). LP supercells are usually found in climates that are more arid, such as the high plains of the United States, and HP supercells are most often found in moist climates. Supercells can occur anywhere in the world under the right pre-existing weather conditions, but they are most common in the Great Plains of the United States in an area known as Tornado Alley and in the Tornado Corridor of Argentina, Uruguay and southern Brazil.<br \/><br \/>\nLoading...<br \/>\nExplanation Statement<br \/><br \/>\nClassic Supercell<br \/>\nSupercell thunderstorms are sometimes classified by meteorologists and storm spotters into three categories. However, not all supercells fit neatly into any one category, being hybrid storms, and many supercells may fall into different categories during different periods of their lifetimes. The standard definition given above is referred to as the Classic supercell. All types of supercells typically produce severe weather.<br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/>\nLow Precipitation<br \/>\n\u2022LP supercells contain a small and relatively light precipitation (rain\/hail) core that is well separated from the updraft. The updraft is intense and LPs are inflow dominant storms. LP supercells is typically more strongly tilted and the deviant rightward motion lesser than for other supercell types. The forward flank downdraft (FFD) is noticeably weaker than for other supercell types and the rear-flank downdraft (RFD) is much weaker\u2014even visually absent in many cases.<br \/>\n\u2022Low-precipitation supercells probably rarely occur, if at all, east of the Mississippi River. They frequently produce large hail, funnel clouds, and wall clouds, and occasionally spawn weak or even strong tornadoes. Radar identification of the storm as a supercell is difficult, especially at great range, because of the relatively small size and dry nature of the storm. Similar to the classic supercell, but unlike the HP storm, severe weather usually occurs in the southwest quadrant of the LP storm.<br \/>\nLoading...<br \/>\nHigh Precipitation<br \/>\n\u2022The HP supercell has a much heavier precipitation core that can wrap all the way around the mesocyclone. These are especially dangerous storms, since the mesocyclone is wrapped with rain and can hide a tornado (if present) from view. These storms also cause flooding due to heavy rain, damaging downbursts and weak tornadoes, although they are also known to produce strong to violent tornadoes. They have a lower potential for damaging hail than Classic and LP supercells, although damaging hail is possible. It has been observed by some spotters that they tend to produce more cloud-to-ground and intracloud lightning than the other types. Also, unlike the LP and Classic types, severe events usually occur at the front (southeast) of the storm. The HP supercell is the most common type of supercell in the United States east of Interstate 35, in the southern parts of the provinces of Ontario and Quebec in Canada, and in the central portions of Argentina and Uruguay.<br \/><br \/><br \/>\nEffects<br \/>\n\u2022Supercells can produce large hail, damaging winds, deadly tornadoes, flooding, dangerous cloud-to-ground lightning, and heavy rain.<br \/>\n\u2022Severe events associated with a supercell almost always occur in the area of the updraft\/downdraft interface. In the Northern Hemisphere, this is most often the rear flank (southwest side) of the precipitation area in LP and classic supercells, but sometimes the leading edge (southeast side) of HP supercells.<br \/>\n\u2022While tornadoes are perhaps the most dramatic of these severe events, all are dangerous. High winds caused by powerful outflow can reach over 148 km\/h (92 mph) and downbursts can cause tornado-like damage. Flooding is the leading cause of death associated with severe weather.<br \/>\n\u2022Note that none of these severe events are exclusive to supercells, although these events are highly predictable once a supercell has formed.<br \/><br \/>\nI need the Conlusion of this text(1 paragraph)!!!<br \/>\n:<br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/>\nBig thankyou to you guys<br \/><br \/>",

Within an economy, this can be broken down into private and public consumption. The more resources a society consumes, the less it has to save or invest, although, paradoxically, higher consumption may encourage higher investment. The life-cycle hypothesis suggests that at certain stages of life individuals are more likely to be saving than consuming, and at other stages they are more likely to be heavy consumers. Some economists argue that consumption taxes are a more efficient form of taxation than taxes on wealth, capital, property or income.<br \/><br \/>\nDo you agree?

Within an economy, this can be broken down into private and public consumption. The <em>more<\/em> resources a <em>soci<\/em>ety consumes, the less it has to save or invest, although, paradoxically, higher consumption may encourage higher investment. The life-cycle hypothesis suggests that at certain stages of life individuals are <em>more<\/em> likely to be saving than consuming, and at other stages they are <em>more<\/em> likely to be heavy consumers. Some economists argue that consumption taxes are a <em>more<\/em> efficient form of taxation than taxes on wealth, capital, property or income.\nDo you agree? Give reasons and examples.\ntolong bantu di jawab yah?",

Many other scientist-philosophers both before and after him have propagated a similar system of medicine based upon the four elements. the four tempraments and recognizing the important of a spiritual level or soul<br \/><br \/><br \/>\nIn the Islamic tradition, the comprehensive perspective of a patient is especially appealing because it emphasizes the role of \u2018Tauhid. Briefly, Tauhid is a basic principle of Islamic thought which, among other things. States that the oneness of the Creator is reflected in aII aspects of the created. Therefore,  more unified understanding of human highlights the unity of the creator for Muslims. Ibn Sina and his Muslim contemporaries were welI versed in both religious sciences and nonreligious sciences. <br \/>\nIbn Sina memorized the Qur'an at an early age and wrote commentaries on various chapters. Their tendency to seek unifying explanations and understanding for their respective disciplines reflects this religious training. Indeed, few sections from the \u2018Canon of Medicine\u2019 or the other texts cited in this paper are without Islamic reference. The common thread modern Muslim physicians of today_can share with their predecessor is the emphasis on \u201cTauhid\" and a holistic perspective of the human. To practice Islamic medicine today would mean that the clinician attempts to incorporate the ideals of 'Tauhid\" with his\/her own understanding of medicine. More specifically. this paper argues that the acceptance of structural, functional, and spiritual levels of a patient  facilitates such a holistic view of the patient.<br \/><br \/>",

Indeed, few sections from the \u2018Canon of Medicine\u2019 or the other texts cited in this paper are without Islamic reference. The common thread modern Muslim physicians of today_can share with their predecessor is the emphasis on \u201cTauhid\" and a holistic perspective of the human. To practice Islamic medicine today would mean that the clinician attempts to incorporate the ideals of 'Tauhid\" with his\/her own understanding of medicine. <em>More<\/em> specifically. this paper argues that the acceptance of structural, functional, and spiritual levels of a patient  facilitates such a holistic view of the patient.",

Most Australians, so this argument goes, live in cities and never get to see these animals. It is claimed that marine parks allow the average Australian to appreciate our marine wildlife. However, as Smith states, dolphins, whales and seals can be viewed in the wild at a number of places on the Australian coast. In fact, there are <em>more<\/em> places where they can be seen in the wild than places where they can be seen in captivity.
