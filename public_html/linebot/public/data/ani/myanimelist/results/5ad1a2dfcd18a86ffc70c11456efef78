These people are known as Blazers, and those who are recognized as such can undergo training at academies to become Mage-Knights. Ikki Kurogane is an aspiring Mage-Knight, despite being considered the worst student at Hagun Academy as an F-ranked Blazer&mdash;the lowest rank possible.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nOne morning, he accidentally stumbles upon Stella Vermillion, a visiting princess and A-ranked Blazer who has just enrolled at Hagun, in a state of undress. As a result, she challenges him to a duel where the loser will be the winner&rsquo;s slave. It seems like a surefire win for Stella, but could there be more to Ikki than meets the eye?<br \/>\n<br \/>\n[i]Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry[\/i] tells the story of Ikki&rsquo;s valiant efforts to qualify for an upcoming tournament that could bring him a step closer to his dreams, aided by Stella. Together, they will prove that hard work can overcome the limits set upon them.",
