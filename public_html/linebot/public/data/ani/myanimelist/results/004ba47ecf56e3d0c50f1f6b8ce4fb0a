            "synopsis": "Tokyo has become a cruel and merciless city&mdash;a place where vicious creatures called &ldquo;ghouls&rdquo; exist alongside humans. The citizens of this once great metropolis live in constant fear of these bloodthirsty savages and their thirst for human flesh. However, the greatest threat these ghouls pose is their dangerous ability to masquerade as humans and blend in with society.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nBased on the best-selling supernatural horror manga by Sui Ishida, [i]Tokyo Ghoul[\/i] follows Ken Kaneki, a shy, bookish college student, who is instantly drawn to Rize Kamishiro, an avid reader like himself. However, Rize is not exactly who she seems, and this unfortunate meeting pushes Kaneki into the dark depths of the ghouls&#039; inhuman world. In a twist of fate, Kaneki is saved by the enigmatic waitress Touka Kirishima, and thus begins his new, secret life as a half-ghoul\/half-human who must find a way to integrate into both societies.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

That&#039;s the attitude of high school delinquent, Taishi Fura, who became a loner after falling out with his peers. One day, he witnesses the brutal attack of a ghoul, which left one of his former friends in the hospital and the other dead. Determined to avenge them, Fura decides to pursue the man-eating monster.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nHis efforts allow him to cross paths with Kishou Arima, a quiet student who also attends his high school. Arima, however, is no ordinary student. Despite his young age, he is a full-fledged investigator of the CCG, a government task force that strives to deal with the ghoul threat. Together, Fura and Arima hunt down the ghoul, known as Lantern, but it soon becomes apparent the monster may be closer than anyone suspects.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nIn this side story, [i]Tokyo Ghoul: &quot;Jack&quot;[\/i] offers a glimpse into the past of Kishou Arima, well before he ever became the CCG&#039;s feared God of Death.",
