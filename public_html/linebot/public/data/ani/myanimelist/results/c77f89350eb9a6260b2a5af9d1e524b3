In the years following this disaster, a group known as the Integrated Enterprise Foundation rose to power. In addition to this massive change, a new breed of humans born with amazing physical skills known as Genestella also emerged and joined the ranks of humanity.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n[i]Gakusen Toshi Asterisk[\/i] follows the story of Ayato Amagiri, a student who has just transferred into one of the six most elite schools for Genestella students in the world&mdash;Seidoukan Academy&mdash;where students learn to control their powers and duel against each other in entertainment battles known as festas.

What most people don&#039;t realize however, is that Ayato has no real interest in festas and instead has an alternative motive for joining this prestigious school. What is Ayato&#039;s big secret? Will he be able to keep up his act when surrounded by some of the greatest Genestella in the world?",
