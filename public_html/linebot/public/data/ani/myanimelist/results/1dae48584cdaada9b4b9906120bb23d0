            "synopsis": "In a world where half-human, half-animal chimeras live and work alongside normal people, there are sure to be a few bad apples in the bunch. Unfortunately, half-human criminals means non-human clues that often leave the police stumped. That&#039;s where lone wolf detectives like Hiroshi Inaba come in. He&#039;s literally part wolf and has the amazing ability to extract critical information just by examining or tasting a sample of someone&#039;s hair! Of course, that ability has also resulted in Inaba having a little bit of a hair fetish, but that doesn&#039;t seem to be a problem for his two assistants. (Well, at least the cross-dressing one isn&#039;t complaining much.) And it&#039;s nothing compared to the strange tastes of Inaba&#039;s nemesis, the omnivorous (and half goat) crime boss Don Valentino, who has an appetite for green legal tender instead of tender young greens! Inaba&#039;s sworn to cut Valentino out of the criminal flock before the Don can wolf down more ill-gotten dough, but he&#039;s going to have to chew his way through a lot of evidence to get his goat. Can sheer dogged detective work put the baaaaad guys behind bars?<br \/>\n<br \/>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)",

            "synopsis": "In 2017, a group of genius scientists achieve a remarkable breakthrough in bioengineering. However, all the new technologies are put into military use, beginning a new round of arms race. Vanguards, as the most significant achievement of the modern bioengineering and the most advanced weapon, are widely utilized in the race. Although vanguards are exceptionally combat-effective, their life expectancy is shortened by the nanomachines they use. Usually, most vanguards will retire from the army after a number of years in service.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nThe heroine Liuli has also consumed too much of her lifespan after executing missions for a long time. With only 380 days left in her life, Liuli receives a new mission, to rescue a hostage being held in a civilian facility. It is without doubt a difficult mission for a vanguard like Liuli, who only knows how to kill and battle. However, Liuli obediently decides to accept the mission in the end.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nDuring the mission, Liuli surprisingly finds that the man who holds the hostage was once a vanguard. The former vanguard Zhongrong Zhou cries and asks the government to hand over the son of Eden. As a vanguard, Liuli feels deep contempt against Zhou. To eliminate the scum of the vanguards, a battle between two vanguards begins...<br \/>\n<br \/>\n(Source: Official site, edited)",
