Because no one could fix their ship, the Japanese Government decided to bestow upon them the designation &quot;DearS&quot; and make them into Japanese citizens, teaching them the language, customs, and culture of Japan. However, in order for them to become more familiar with human society, a home-stay program has been enacted to allow them to mingle with other humans.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nOne misty morning, a truck carrying a capsule that housed one of these aliens ends up dropping it into the riverbank, releasing her from her confinement. She is eventually found by a high school student named Takeya Ikuhara, who saves her from being hit by a truck and takes pity on her, despite being extremely distrustful of their race and wanting nothing to do with them. Upon being named Ren, she imprints upon him as her &quot;Master&quot; and serves as his personal &quot;Slave,&quot; leaving him with a &quot;DearS&quot; who wants to remain with him no matter what and bringing his ordinary, alien-free days to an end.",
