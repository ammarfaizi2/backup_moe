But after the passing of his mother, Saki Arima, Kousei falls into a downward spiral, rendering him unable to hear the sound of his own piano.<br \/>\n <br \/>\nTwo years later, Kousei still avoids the piano, leaving behind his admirers and rivals, and lives a colorless life alongside his friends Tsubaki Sawabe and Ryouta Watari. However, everything changes when he meets a beautiful violinist, Kaori Miyazono, who stirs up his world and sets him on a journey to face music again.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nBased on the manga series of the same name, [i]Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso[\/i] approaches the story of Kousei&#039;s recovery as he discovers that music is more than playing each note perfectly, and a single melody can bring in the fresh spring air of April.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
