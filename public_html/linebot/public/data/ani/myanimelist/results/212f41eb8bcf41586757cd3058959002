His older sister calls him to transfer to a strategic defense school, where many of the students (many of which are large-breasted girls) use their HHG abilities to fight invaders from another world while wearing extremely skimpy pilot outfits.

It looks like his new school life is going to be full of embarrassment<br \/>\n<br \/>\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
