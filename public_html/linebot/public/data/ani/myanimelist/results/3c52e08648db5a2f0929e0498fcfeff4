In opposition to this plan are the slightly nutty Kyuusaku Natsume and Nuku Nuku, the android who acts as a companion to his young son. Nuku Nuku&#039;s classmates are all eccentrics, Futaba, the class president, is a domineering control-freak, who cannot leave her authority in school. Chieko Shirakaba is the rich snob with the two yes-girls who always take her side. There is a bookworm, a mystic, a scientist, and a pop singer. All of these are true to their descriptions: the mystic is always foretelling doom via tarot cards, spirits, or some other occult technique. The pop singer never says anything except as a song. The bookworm always has her nose in a book. These eccentricities add to the series&#039; humor. <br \/>\n<br \/>\n(Source: ANN)",

Soon after, a violent typhoon traps the family on the island and a string of mysterious murders commence, forcing the eighteen people on the island to fight for their lives in a deadly struggle between fantasy and reality.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

He spends most of his time at school fending off Chise Umenomori, the granddaughter of the board chairman and a pampered princess, who is constantly roping him into her eccentric hobbies. After school, he goes to work at the &quot;Stray Cats&quot; confectionery, a cake shop run by his adoptive older sister, Otome Tsuzuki, until it&#039;s time to go to bed. This is the average routine in the day and the life of Takumi.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n[i]Mayoi Neko Overrun[\/i] follows another seemingly average day in the life of Takumi. With his sister away from the shop, having gone to save someone else in need of help, Fumino takes it upon herself to wake him up so that he won&#039;t be late for their usual walk to school together, giving him a glimpse of her blue and white striped panties in the process. What a nice way to start the day.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nWhen Otome returns home, she brings with her a girl named Nozomi Kiriya, whose hair and mannerisms resemble that of a large cat. It turns out that she is a runaway that Otome can&#039;t help but take in.

            "synopsis": "The Acorns and the Wildcat is a unique short film in picture-book format from the creator of Night on the Galactic Railroad and Gauche the Cellist. Unusually for an anime, a narrator reads Kenji&#039;s story aloud while the action is played out on the screen by a succession of warm and evocative illustrations brought to life by subtle touches of animation. If the film feels somehow familiar yet you can&#039;t put your finger on the reason why, it&#039;s probably the sumptuously minimalist animation by Yasuhiro Nagura, who was the animation director of Mamoru Oshii&#039;s artsy 1986 feature Angel&#039;s Egg. That, and Kenji&#039;s wildcat is said to have been the inspiration for Miyazaki&#039;s Panda\/Totoro creature. The idea of reading Kenji&#039;s story aloud instead of playing it out as a drama is quite refreshing, and Kenji&#039;s magical language and narrative style are entirely sufficient to sustain interest. Combined with the spacey music and breathtaking art, the result is a pleasantly unassuming little gem of a film.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n(Source: pelleas.net)",
