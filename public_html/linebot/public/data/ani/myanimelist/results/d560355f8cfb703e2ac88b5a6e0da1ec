Earth is now mostly uninhabitable, and thus a remnant of humanity has resided on the Moon while the Earth and its few survivors recover. For years, the &quot;Moonrace,&quot; people of the Moon, have continued to check if Earth is fit for resettlement.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nA boy named Rolan Cehack and two others are sent down to Earth for a reconnaissance mission. Rolan ends up spending a year on the planet working for the Heim Family, aristocrats living in a Victorian-like society. This family, like others of similar wealthy status, celebrates one&#039;s coming of age with a ceremony involving a giant stone statue known as the &quot;White Doll.&quot;<br \/>\n<br \/>\nTo Rolan&#039;s surprise, the Moonrace suddenly touches down on Earth with the intent of taking it by force. During the attack, the White Doll is broken apart, revealing a mobile suit called the &quot;Turn A Gundam&quot; inside. With Rolan in its cockpit, the Turn A causes a standoff between the forces of Earth and Moon. The young pilot, along with the people of both sides, must keep the peace and avoid another all-out, catastrophic war.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
