        "synopsis": "One year ago, Sagiri Izumi became step-siblings with Masamune Izumi. But the sudden death of their parents tears their new family apart, resulting in Sagiri becoming a shut-in which cut her off from her brother and society.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nWhile caring for what&#039;s left of his family, Masamune earns a living as a published light novel author with one small problem: he&#039;s never actually met his acclaimed illustrator, Eromanga-sensei, infamous for drawing the most lewd erotica. Through an embarrassing chain of events, he learns that his very own little sister was his partner the whole time!<br \/>\n<br \/>\nAs new characters and challenges appear, Masamune and Sagiri must now face the light novel industry together. [i]Eromanga-Sensei[\/i] follows the development of their relationship and their struggle to become successful; and as Sagiri slowly grows out of her shell, just how long will she be able to hide her true persona from the rest of the world?<br \/>\n<br \/>\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
