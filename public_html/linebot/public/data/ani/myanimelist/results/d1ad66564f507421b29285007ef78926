            "synopsis": "When Takeru Amato moved into his new apartment in Akihabara, he was warned that there was one problem with it. He wasn&rsquo;t warned, however, that the problem was a hole in the floor that leads to the realm of the zodiac gods. He also wasn&rsquo;t told about Nyaa-tan, the eccentric, immature, prospective zodiac-sign cat.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nNyaa-tan would like nothing more than to join the rest of the girls, otherwise known as Eto-shin, in the Chineze zodiac, but she&rsquo;s going to have to fight to work her way in. Fortunately, establishing a relationship with Takeru can help her with that. In [i]Etotama[\/i] the members of the zodiac don&rsquo;t just represent people&rsquo;s births; they draw their power from positive human emotions in the form of energy called Sol\/Lull. With this power, the Eto-musume, or potential Eto-shin, can change from their mostly humanoid appearances into smaller &ldquo;pretty modes&rdquo; that can battle with each other in the Eto world.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nNyaa-tan needs to get Takeru to warm up to him fast, and not just because they&rsquo;re living together. The ETM12 selection festival to determine the next member of the zodiac is coming soon. With Takeru&rsquo;s good graces, Nyaa-tan just might be able to fight off the other Eto-musume and the 12 Eto-shin themselves, and finally take her place in the zodiac.",
