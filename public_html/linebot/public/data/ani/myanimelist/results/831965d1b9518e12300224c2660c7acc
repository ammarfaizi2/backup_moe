His older sister calls him to transfer to a strategic defense school, where many of the students (many of which are large-breasted girls) use their HHG abilities to fight invaders from another world while wearing extremely skimpy pilot outfits. Kizuna&#039;s fighting ability doesn&#039;t measure up, but his sister has another plan&mdash;apparently having erotic experiences with Kizuna will allow the girls to replenish their energy or power-up. It looks like his new school life is going to be full of embarrassment<br \/>\n<br \/>\n(Source: MangaHelpers)",
