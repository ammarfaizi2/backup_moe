Once the front door closes, the real fun begins. When she dons her hamster hoodie, she transforms from a refined, over-achieving student into a lazy, junk food-eating otaku, leaving all the housework to her responsible older brother Taihei. Whether she&#039;s hanging out with her friends Nana Ebina and Kirie Motoba, or competing with her self-proclaimed &quot;rival&quot; Sylphinford Tachibana, Umaru knows how to kick back and have some fun!<br \/>\n<br \/>\n[i]Himouto! Umaru-chan[\/i] is a cute story that follows the daily adventures of Umaru and Taihei, as they take care of&mdash;and put up with&mdash;each other the best they can, as well as the unbreakable bonds between friends and siblings.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
