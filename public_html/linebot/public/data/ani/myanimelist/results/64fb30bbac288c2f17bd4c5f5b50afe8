This leaves the remainder of the world completely powerless, and Izuku Midoriya is one such individual.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nSince he was a child, the ambitious middle schooler has wanted nothing more than to be a hero. Izuku&#039;s unfair fate leaves him admiring heroes and taking notes on them whenever he can. But it seems that his persistence has borne some fruit: Izuku meets the number one hero and his personal idol, All Might. All Might&#039;s quirk is a unique ability that can be inherited, and he has chosen Izuku to be his successor!<br \/>\n<br \/>\nEnduring many months of grueling training, Izuku enrolls in UA High, a prestigious high school famous for its excellent hero training program, and this year&#039;s freshmen look especially promising. With his bizarre but talented classmates and the looming threat of a villainous organization, Izuku will soon learn what it really means to be a hero.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
