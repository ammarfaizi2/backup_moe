Greeting them are childhood friends Nao Yorihime and  Akira Amatsume, and newcomer Kazuha Migiwa. It is a warm welcome, symbolic of the days that should come.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nTheir peace is merely ephemeral, however, as suppressed emotions, born from vows both newfound and forgotten, start exerting their influence on the twins&#039; new lives. And deep down, a dark secret, only known to them, begins to unshackle.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nBased on the visual novel by Sphere, [i]Yosuga no Sora[\/i] not only explores the power of lost memories and true love when the bonds of many become intertwined, but also raises the questions of morality and social acceptance.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
