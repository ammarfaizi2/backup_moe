When his father suddenly brings home two beautiful girls and introduces them as his new siblings, he has no choice but to accept into his family the Naruse sisters: busty redhead Mio and petite silver-haired Maria.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nBut when these seemingly normal girls reveal themselves as demons&mdash;Mio the former Demon Lord&#039;s only daughter and Maria her trusted succubus servant&mdash;Basara is forced to reveal himself as a former member of a clan of &quot;Heroes,&quot; sworn enemies of the demons. However, having begun to care for his new sisters, Basara instead decides to protect them with his powers and forms a master-servant contract with Mio to keep watch over her.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nWith the Heroes observing his every move and the constant threat of hostile demons, Basara has to do the impossible to protect his new family members. Moreover, the protector himself is hiding his own dark secret that still haunts him to this day...<br \/>\n<br \/>\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

It&#039;s even harder having to defend them from the power hungry denizens of the demonic underworld. Such is the life of Basara Toujou; and he&#039;s done a pretty decent job of managing it so far. <br \/>\n<br \/>\n[i]Shinmai Maou no Testament Burst[\/i] directly follows the events of the previous season, with Basara and his sisters Mio and Maria Naruse attempting to enjoy a somewhat normal life. The best laid plans of demons and men oft go awry however, and Basara, Mio, and their friends begin to face a number of new threats. <br \/>\n<br \/>\nAs if the situation couldn&#039;t get complicated enough, Maria&#039;s older sister Rukia shows up, insisting that Basara and the Naruse sisters must come to the realm of demons.",
