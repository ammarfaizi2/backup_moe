He desires to leave his home behind and join the mercenary group known as Gekkostate, hoping to find some adventure to brighten up his mundane life. However, stuck between his grandfather&#039;s insistence to become a mechanic like him and the pressure of his deceased father&#039;s legacy, the only excitement Renton finds is in his pastime of riding the Trapar wave particles that are dispersed throughout the air, an activity akin to surfing.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nEverything changes when an unknown object crashes through Renton&#039;s garage, discovered to be a Light Finding Operation&mdash;a robot capable of riding the Trapar waves&mdash;specifically known as the Nirvash typeZERO. Its pilot is a young girl named Eureka, a member of the Gekkostate, who requests a tune-up for the Nirvash. Their meeting sparks the beginning of Renton&#039;s involvement with the Gekkostate as he takes off alongside Eureka as the co-pilot of the Nirvash.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

In fact, there seems to be no case that she can&#039;t solve, or any culprit that escapes justice. But within the walls of her detective agency lies the secret to her prolific crime-solving skills: the cases are actually solved by her assistant, Neuro Nougami.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nHowever, to call Neuro an ordinary man would be incorrect. In reality, he is a demon, who came to the human world in search of the ultimate mystery, having already solved every mystery in the demon world. With Yako as his proxy, he feasts on the negative energy released by humans when they commit crimes. Thus, he promises to help Yako solve the mystery of her father&#039;s death. But to do so, he must avoid drawing too much attention to himself, which is why Yako plays the role of the detective.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n[i]Majin Tantei Nougami Neuro[\/i] follows this unlikely duo as they solve case after case to satisfy Neuro&#039;s ravenous appetite and Yako&#039;s desperate search for the truth of her father&#039;s death.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
