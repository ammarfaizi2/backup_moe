The RSF is often regarded as a failure both by the country&#039;s citizens and a government more interested in precipitating a war with a neighboring country than scientific achievement. Following the funeral of a fellow cadet, an unmotivated Shiro is walking in the city one night, when he bumps into Riquinni Nonderaiko, a young, pious woman, genuinely enthusiastic about the significance of space exploration.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nAs the two gradually bond, Riquinni&#039;s encouragement inspires Shiro to volunteer as a pilot for a prospective rocket ship, potentially becoming Honneamise&#039;s first man in space. Shiro and the RSF are soon joined by a team of elderly but eager scientists and engineers, and together, they embark on a mission to mold their nation&#039;s space program into a success. However, their efforts soon catch the attention of the government, which seems to have a different plan for the RSF in mind. Even as the odds are stacked against them, these men and women continue to stubbornly look to the sky, because somewhere among the frontiers of space may lie humanity&#039;s last chance at redemption.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

This time they arrange a world cup with 4 teams: Japan, USA, \"All Europe\", and \"All South America\". In the first match, Japan easily defeats the USA 3:0 and in the second match Europe loses 2:3 against South America. In the final round S.A. shows their \"soccer cyborg\" Carlos Santana, a more than supreme player who seems to be undefeatable. All their classical tricks like Hyugas \"Tiger Shot\" or Tsubasas \"Top Spin\" seem to be totally worthless, but in a hard and spectacular match the Japanese learn more and more to play in unison and finally they get the win.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n(Source: ANN)",

After one very romantic gesture by a popular upperclassman, she falls head over heels for who she believes to be her one true love. Unfortunately, love can be deceiving, as her feelings are soon proven to be one-sided; the upperclassman directly tells her that she&rsquo;s annoying and that she needs to stop bothering him. How&#039;s that for some tough love?<br \/>\n<br \/>\nShortly after this horrific heartbreak, her good friend Yuri suffers from a sprained wrist, making it impossible for her to continue her position as the basketball team&#039;s manager. After some coaxing on Yuri&#039;s part, Tsubasa decides to take on the role in her place. This may be the perfect opportunity for Tsubasa to move on and forget about her unrequited love.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nOn Tsubasa&rsquo;s first day as a manager, the team&rsquo;s shooting guard Aki Hidaka saves her from being hit by a ball. Is this another fateful encounter? Or just a random, meaningless event? One thing is for certain: Tsubasa&rsquo;s days will never be the same again.",
